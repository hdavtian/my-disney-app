The Queen is jealous because she wants to be known as the fairest in the land, and Snow White's beauty surpasses her own. The Dwarfs grow to love their unexpected visitor, who cleans their house and cooks their meals. But one day when they are at their diamond mine, the Queen arrives at the cottage, disguised as an old peddler woman, and she persuades Snow White to bite into a poisoned apple. The Dwarfs, warned by the forest animals, rush home to chase the witch away, but they are too late to save Snow White. They place her in a glass coffin in the woods, and mourn for her. The Prince, who has fallen for Snow White, happens by and awakens her from the wicked Queen's deathlike spell by love's first kiss. Supervising director was David Hand. Premiered on December 21, 1937, at the Carthay Circle Theater in Hollywood, it was the first animated feature film.",

    "long_description": "Pinocchio (film) A wooden puppet is brought to life by the Blue Fairy, with the promise he can become a real boy if he earns it. He is led astray by the wicked Honest John and his companion, Gideon, who turn him over to an evil puppeteer, Stromboli. Pinocchio is sent to Pleasure Island, where the wicked boys are turned into donkeys, but he escapes with the aid of his friend and conscience Jiminy Cricket, and eventually redeems himself by saving his father, Geppetto, who had been swallowed by Monstro, the whale. The Blue Fairy rewards Pinocchio by turning him into a real boy. From an original serialized story written for a children&rsquo;s magazine by Collodi (the pen name of Carlo Lorenzini) in 1881. Premiered in New York on February 7, 1940. Directed by Ben Sharpsteen and Hamilton Luske. Voices include Dickie Jones (Pinocchio), Cliff Edwards (Jiminy Cricket), Christian Rub (Geppetto), Evelyn Venable (Blue Fairy). 87 min. The film required the talents of 750 artists, including animators, assistants, inbetweeners, layout artists, background painters, special-effects animators, and inkers and painters, who produced more than 2 million drawings and used some 1,500 shades of paint for the Technicolor production. Jiminy Cricket became the film&rsquo;s most popular and enduring character, appearing in subsequent Disney films and television shows, including Fun and Fancy Free and the Mickey Mouse Club . The character, brought to life by animator Ward Kimball, was only a minor one in Collodi&rsquo;s tale, in which he was eventually squashed by Pinocchio. The Disney film gave him a much more important role. Gustaf Tenggren, an award-winning illustrator, was assigned to the production to give the film the kind of lavish European storybook flavor that Walt Disney envisioned. Academy Award winner for Best Score and Best Song (&ldquo;When You Wish Upon a Star&rdquo;). Other songs include &ldquo;Hi Diddle Dee Dee&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve Got No Strings.&rdquo; Many film historians describe the film as the most beautifully realized and technically perfect of all the Disney animated features. The film cost $2.6 million in 1940, but using the same techniques and processes, it would cost well over $100 million today. Pinocchio was re-released theatrically in 1945, 1954, 1962, 1971, 1978, and 1984. In 1992 it again returned to theaters in a new, painstakingly restored print by Buena Vista Worldwide Services and YCM Labs of Burbank. It was released on video in 1985 and 1993.

    "long_description": "Fantasia (film) One of the most highly regarded of the Disney classics, a symphonic concert with Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra, embellished by Disney animation. Directed by Samuel Armstrong, James Algar, Bill Roberts, Paul Satterfield, Hamilton Luske, Jim Handley, Ford Beebe, T. Hee, Norm Ferguson, and Wilfred Jackson. Narrated by Deems Taylor. Includes eight sequences: Toccata and Fugue in D Minor (Bach), The Nutcracker Suite (Tchaikovsky), The Sorcerer&rsquo;s Apprentice (Dukas), Rite of Spring (Stravinsky), Pastoral Symphony &nbsp; (Beethoven), Dance of the Hours (Ponchielli), Night on Bald Mountain (Mussorgsky), and Ave Maria (Schubert). Premiered on November 13, 1940, at the Broadway Theater in New York. The film was presented in Fantasound, an early stereo system, devised at the Disney Studio, but which required theaters to be specially equipped. Because of the expense, the film originally opened in only 14 theaters. The stereo sound enhanced the effect of the movie and won special certificates for Walt Disney, technicians William Garity and John N. A. Hawkins and RCA, and for Leopold Stokowski and his associates (for unique achievement in the creation of a new form of visualized music) at the 1941 Academy Awards. 125 min. New interest in the film in the 1970s led to a new sound track in 1982, with the orchestra conducted by Irwin Kostal, narration by Hugh Douglas, and a recording in digital stereo, but its full-length restoration in 1990 brought back the original sound track, while trying to duplicate some of the effects of the Fantasound presentation. The film was re-released theatrically in 1946, 1956, 1963, 1969, 1977, 1982, 1985, and 1990. Released on video in 1991. Corey Burton replaced Deems Taylor on the DVD. Fantasia has taken its place as one of the great cinematic classics of all time. It took 60 years, but in line with Walt Disney&rsquo;s plan to add new segments regularly to the film, Fantasia/2000 retained The Sorcerer&rsquo;s Apprentice but added eight new sequences.

After explorations of an art class, dialogue stage, sound effects stage, multiplane camera department, story and animation departments, he discovers Walt has already finished the cartoon version of his story.&nbsp; In the story department, actor Alan Ladd, portraying a Disney storyman, tells of Baby Weems, a child prodigy whose fame takes him away from his parents until a serious illness makes him a regular baby once more. In the final segment, the audience learns about the poetry-writing dragon who must prove his mettle if he wants to coexist with a neighboring village. He and Sir Giles stage a mock battle in order to show everyone that the dragon really is fierce. Released on June 20, 1941. Directed by Alfred Werker.

He and his mother suffer humiliation from the other elephants and from the kids visiting the circus. But humiliation turns to triumph as Dumbo is surprised to discover through the help of his faithful mouse friend, Timothy, that he can use the oversized ears to fly. Released on October 23, 1941. Directed by Ben Sharpsteen. From a story by Helen Aberson and Harold Pearl. 64 min. Voices include Edward Brophy (Timothy), Sterling Holloway (stork), and Cliff Edwards (Dandy Crow). Among the songs are &ldquo;Baby Mine,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pink Elephants on Parade,&rdquo; and &ldquo;When I See an Elephant Fly.&rdquo; The film won an Oscar for Best Scoring of a Motion Picture (Frank Churchill and Oliver Wallace), and was nominated for Best Song (&ldquo;Baby Mine&rdquo;). From the time that Walt first read the galleys for the story, he knew it would make a fine film. &nbsp;Coming after two expensive movies ( Fantasia and Pinocchio ) the previous year, Dumbo was made for only $812,000, partly because it was able to move very quickly through the animation department due to its succinct story and clearcut characters, and it made a welcome profit for the Studio. Dumbo had been scheduled for the cover of Time magazine at the time of its general release in December 1941, but a much more momentous event occurred&mdash;Pearl Harbor&mdash;and poor Dumbo was supplanted by Japanese General Yamamoto. The movie was re-released in theaters in 1949, 1959, 1972, and 1976. It was shown on the Disney television series in 1955; it was released on video in 1981. Dumbella Dumbo (live-action film)",

But in the meantime he suffers through the death of his mother at the hand of hunters, falls in love with Faline, and barely escapes a catastrophic forest fire. World premiere in London on August 9, 1942; released in the U.S. on August 13, 1942. Based on the book by Felix Salten. The supervising director was David Hand. Voices include Bobby Stewart/Donnie Dunagan/Hardy Albright/John Sutherland (Bambi), Paula Winslowe (Bambi&rsquo;s mother), Cammie King/Ann Gillis (Faline), Fred Shields (Bambi&rsquo;s father), Bill Wright (Friend Owl), Stanley Alexander/Sterling Holloway/Tim Davis (Flower), Peter Behn/Tim Davis (Thumper). &nbsp;Includes the songs &ldquo;Love Is a Song&rdquo; and &ldquo;Little April Shower,&rdquo; written by Frank Churchill and Larry Morey. The film had been put into production as work on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was winding down. But the story of Bambi was different from anything else the Studio had ever attempted. It was more serious, and all the characters were animals. In striving for realism, the artists heard lectures from animal experts, made field trips to the Los Angeles Zoo, watched specially filmed nature footage shot in the forests of Maine, and even studied the movements of two fawns that were donated to the Studio. The meticulous work was time-consuming; even taking care to see that the spots on the fawn&rsquo;s back remained constant meant fewer drawings could be finished in a day. The film moved exceedingly slowly through the production process, but Walt was delighted with the results he was seeing. &ldquo;Fellas, this stuff is pure gold,&rdquo; he told the animators. Bambi was released at a difficult time, with the United States deep in World War II, so its initial profits were low, but the story of the little deer coming of age has endured, and today, Bambi is universally regarded as one of Walt Disney&rsquo;s most charming films. The film received Academy Award nominations for Best Sound, Best Song (&ldquo;Love Is a Song&rdquo;), and Best Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture. 70 min. It was rereleased in theaters in 1942, 1947, 1957, 1966, 1975, 1982, 1988. Released on video in 1989 and 1997. Baloo&rsquo;s Dressing Room Bambi II (film)",

He unwraps a 16mm projector and views The Cold-Blooded Penguin about Pablo Penguin who flees the cold for a tropical isle and then misses the winter. Then he views The Flying Gauchito, about a racing donkey with wings; Baia, in which Donald and José go to Baia, meet a cookie girl, and dance; and La Piñata, in which Donald learns of Las Posadas, the children’s procession before Christmas, and finds friendly shelter and the breaking of the piñata. Interspersed throughout the film is live action of native dancing and Latin American songs. The world premiere was in Mexico City on December 21, 1944; released in the United States on February 3, 1945. Directed by Norm Ferguson. 71 min. It was re-released in theaters in an abridged version in 1977 at a time when the film had gained increased awareness because of its almost psychedelic sequences. Released on video in 1982. Aurora Miranda, sister of Hollywood star Carmen, dances with Donald in the Baia sequence, showing how far the Studio had advanced the art of combining animation with live actors. This is the first time Walt Disney had attempted incorporating live-action characters in an animated scene since the Alice Comedies in the 1920s. Songs from the film include “You Belong to My Heart,” “Baia,” and “The Three Caballeros.” Parts of the film were released separately as shorts and extracts appeared in the educational film, Creative Film Adventures, No. 1, in 1976.

Little Johnny is taken to his grandmother’s plantation where he meets Uncle Remus and is guided by his stories (“Running Away,” “The Tar Baby,” and “The Laughing Place”) about Brer Rabbit, Brer Fox, and Brer Bear. Johnny finds friendship with a local girl, Ginny Favers, but is bullied by her cruel brothers. When he is accidentally gored by a bull, it takes more than Uncle Remus to save him. His parents must reunite, creating a happy family once more. The film was nominated for Best Scoring of a Musical Picture and received an Oscar for Best Song (“Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah”) and an honorary Oscar to James Baskett for his portrayal of Uncle Remus. Premiered on November 12, 1946, at Loew’s Grand in Atlanta. Directed by Harve Foster; cartoon direction by Wilfred Jackson. 94 min. Stars Ruth Warrick (Sally), Bobby Driscoll (Johnny), James Baskett (Uncle Remus), Luana Patten (Ginny), Hattie McDaniel (Tempy). Based on the stories of Joel Chandler Harris. Other songs included “Uncle Remus Said,” “How Do You Do?” and “Ev’rybody’s Got a Laughing Place.” The film and its songs provided the inspiration for the Splash Mountain attractions in the Disney parks. Bobby Driscoll and Luana Patten were Disney’s first contract players, since this was the Studio’s first major plunge into live-action filmmaking. But since Walt Disney was considered an animated film producer, it was felt that the film should contain at least some animated sequences. Thus, Uncle Remus’s stories are shown in animation, along with some clever combinations of the live action and animated characters. The film was reissued in 1956, 1972, 1980, and 1986.",

Bobby Driscoll, the young lead, received a special outstanding juvenile Oscar for his movies that year (which included the non-Disney film, The Window ). Filmed in Sequoia National Park and the San Joaquin Valley of California. The train station used on the set had another life after the film was shot. Disney artist Ward Kimball was given the station by Walt Disney to install at his Southern California home. Kimball was an avid railroad buff who had railroad tracks running down his driveway, and he enjoyed surprising new neighbors by stoking up his full-size locomotive on a Sunday afternoon. The film was reissued in 1964 and released on video in 1986 and 1992. Snowball Express (film) So Random! (television)",

    "long_description": "Cinderella (film) Animated feature; the famous rags-to-riches tale of a beautiful girl reduced to being a servant by her jealous Stepmother and Stepsisters, Anastasia and Drizella. With the help of a bit of magic by her Fairy Godmother, Cinderella is given a beautiful dress and use of a magnificent coach, and is able to attend a royal ball and inadvertently fall in love with the prince. Fleeing the ball at midnight, the hour when the magic spell is due to end, she leaves behind a glass slipper that the prince and Grand Duke use to search her out. With the help of her little mice and bird friends, she is discovered and assured a happy future.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cinderella was voiced by Ilene Woods, with Eleanor Audley voicing the Stepmother and Verna Felton the Fairy Godmother. Mike Douglas is the uncredited singing voice of Prince Charming. Released on February 15, 1950. Directed by Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske, and Clyde Geronimi. 74 min. Songs include &ldquo;A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Work Song,&rdquo; &ldquo;So This Is Love,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo,&rdquo; all by Mack David, Jerry Livingston, and Al Hoffman, with &ldquo;Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo&rdquo; nominated for the Academy Award for Best Song. The film also received a nomination for Best Scoring of Musical Picture. During its original release, the public made the film one of the highest grossing films of the year, and Disney&rsquo;s most successful release since Bambi . Because of wartime economic problems, the Disney Studio had had to be satisfied with its &ldquo;package films&rdquo; such as Make Mine Music and Melody Time for several years, but by the end of the 1940s, Walt Disney was able to put together the financing for another full feature telling a single story. It was a gamble for Disney, and if it had been unsuccessful, it probably would have sounded the death knell for animation at the Studio. But its resounding success ensured that animation would continue. Cinderella was re-released in theaters in 1957, 1965, 1973, 1981, and 1987. Released on video in 1988 and 1995.

    "long_description": "Treasure Island (film) Young Jim Hawkins, possessor of a map to buried treasure, and his friends, Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey, plan to travel to Treasure Island to hunt for the treasure. Captain Smollett rounds up a crew that includes Long John Silver, who secretly plots a mutiny to secure the map and treasure for himself. When the mutiny fails, Silver escapes, taking Jim with him. When they reach the island, Jim gets away and meets a strange old hermit named Ben Gunn who helps him return to his crewmates, now battling the pirates led by Silver. Finally, the Squire, Smollett, and Gunn disarm Silver, and Gunn leads them to the treasure he had rehidden years earlier. With their captive and the treasure, the crew rows back to the ship, only to have Silver escape with the rowboat, aided by Jim, who has a grudging affection for the rascally pirate. Released on July 19, 1950. Based on the book published in 1881 by Robert Louis Stevenson. Directed by Byron Haskin. The first Disney live-action film without any animation. Also the first Disney film shot in England, in locations off the Cornish coast and Falmouth Bay. 96 min. Stars Bobby Driscoll as Jim Hawkins and Robert Newton as Long John Silver, with Basil Sydney (Capt. Smollett), Finlay Currie (Capt. Bones), Walter Fitzgerald (Squire Trelawney), Denis O&rsquo;Dea (Dr. Livesey), Geoffrey Wilkinson (Ben Gunn). The Disney company had &ldquo;blocked funds&rdquo; in England after the war, money that Disney films had earned in the country, which could not be exported due to currency regulations. Walt Disney decided that he could use the money to make some films in England, but since he could not find trained animators there to produce his usual fare, he decided to turn to live action instead. Over the next few years, four live-action films would be made in England. Disney found itself in trouble with British child labor laws when they imported an American boy to star in the film, and it took a bit of deception and cunning to get the film completed. The film was cut for its 1975 re-release in order to gain a G rating, but the so-called violent scenes were restored on a later video release. Released on video in 1981 and 1992.

    "long_description": "Alice in Wonderland (film) Animated version of Lewis Carroll&rsquo;s famous story of Alice and her adventures after falling down a rabbit hole. Following a White Rabbit, she meets such strange creatures as a talking doorknob, who helps her through a keyhole into Wonderland, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, who tell the story of &ldquo;The Walrus and the Carpenter,&rdquo; the Caterpillar, and the Mad Hatter and the March Hare celebrating an unbirthday at their tea party. Finally Alice has a showdown with the Queen of Hearts and her army of playing cards. The whole thing becomes such a nightmare that Alice awakens from her dream to the recitations of her sister and the purring of her cat, Dinah. Alice is voiced by Kathryn Beaumont. Other voices include Verna Felton (Queen), Bill Thompson (White Rabbit), Ed Wynn (Mad Hatter), Jerry Colonna (March Hare), and Sterling Holloway (Cheshire Cat). Premiered in England on July 26, 1951 and released in the U.S. two days later. Directed by Clyde Geronimi, Hamilton Luske, and Wilfred Jackson. Songs include &ldquo;All in the Golden Afternoon,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Late,&rdquo; by Bob Hilliard and Sammy Fain, and &ldquo;The Unbirthday Song,&rdquo; by Mack David, Al Hoffman, and Jerry Livingston. 75 min. Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Scoring of a Musical Picture. This animated feature had been on Walt Disney&rsquo;s mind since 1933, when he considered a live action version starring Mary Pickford. He shelved the project after Paramount made a version, but later had artist David Hall, a Hollywood artist and designer, create some concepts for an all-animated film. World War II intervened, and it was not until the late 1940s that work began again in earnest. One of Walt&rsquo;s big problems with this film was that here he was dealing with a highly regarded classic, and what was charming and appropriately bizarre in book form seemed oddly out of place on the motion picture screen. Walt&rsquo;s feeling, expressed in later years, was that Alice had no &ldquo;heart.&rdquo; An edited version aired on television on November 3, 1954. The film was rediscovered by the psychedelic generation, when it was made available on 16mm for schools, and it was rereleased in theaters in 1974 and 1981. Released on video in 1981 and 1986 and kept in release. Alice in Wonderland (film, 2010) Alice in Wonderland Maze",

Though the desert to most people represents an area of arid desolation, it is really a place teeming with life, including extraordinary plants, desert tortoises, rattlesnakes, scorpions, kangaroo rats, and roadrunners. A flash flood hits the desert, causing much of the plant life to blossom anew. The film stands as a landmark of factual filmmaking. 69 min. Academy Award winner. As Walt Disney had had a difficult time convincing his distributor, RKO, of the value of the True-Life Adventure featurettes, he had renewed problems when he produced his first feature-length True-Life Adventure. Again they argued that audiences would not pay money to see a one-hour-plus film about desert creatures. But again, Disney knew they were wrong. This time he went to Roy Disney and together they decided that it was time to part company with RKO and handle the releases of the Disney product themselves. With some trepidation they made the break and set up the Buena Vista Distribution Company, with its first release being The Living Desert. This film, made for only about $500,000, went out and made $5 million during its original release, and Walt and Roy knew they had made the right decision. Released on video in 1986.",

They discover that the “monster” which they searched for is in reality the first man-made submarine, the Nautilus, commanded by Captain Nemo, a madman who is willing to share his secrets of nuclear energy with the world only on his own terms. Land rescues Nemo from the clutches of a giant squid and eventually manages to alert the outside world as to the location of Nemo’s secret island base. Nemo and his creations are destroyed. Released on December 23, 1954. Based on the classic story by Jules Verne. Academy Award winner for Best Special Effects and Best Art Decoration/Set Decoration (John Meehan and Emile Kuri); nominated also for Best Film Editing. 127 min. The first Disney feature filmed in CinemaScope. Disney special effects wizards constructed the giant squid of rubber, steel spring, flexible tubing, glass cloth, Lucite, and plastic, with tentacles measuring 40 feet with two feelers of 50 feet. It could rear up eight feet out of water, its tentacles and feelers moving with frightening realism. It took a staff of 28 men to operate the intricate remote controls. Using hydraulics, electronics, and compressed air, they succeeded in giving a lifelike appearance to the squid. But there were problems. The squid fight had to be filmed a second time after Walt Disney and the director, Richard Fleischer, were unhappy with the initial results. It had been filmed in a special tank on brand-new soundstage 3 at the Disney Studio as if it was sunset on a placid sea; unfortunately this allowed viewers to see too much of the mechanics that enabled the squid to move, and it looked too fake. Instead, the scene was shot a second time, as if it was a stormy night, with 100 backstage workers on hand providing the needed lightning, rain, turbulent seas, and hurricane winds, and everything worked much better. The movie featured the song, “A Whale of a Tale” by Al Hoffman and Norman Gimbel. Director Fleischer was the son of Walt’s early animation rival, Max Fleischer, who created the Out of the Inkwell and Betty Boop cartoons, and Disney made sure that Max did not object before he hired his son. Stars James Mason (Capt. Nemo), Kirk Douglas (Ned Land), Paul Lukas (Prof. Aronnax), Peter Lorre (Conseil). Locations for the film included the Disney and 20th Century-Fox lots in California, and various locales in the Bahamas and Jamaica. The Nautilus was designed by Harper Goff. Reissued in theaters in 1963 and 1971. Released on video in 1980, 1985, and 1992. A television show on the making of the film, Operation Undersea, won the Emmy for best television program of the year. The Nautilus set was displayed for a time at Disneyland.",

They enjoy several outings together, including a memorable spaghetti dinner by moonlight at Tony’s, but their relationship is strained not only by Lady’s loyalty to her human family and their newborn baby, but by Tramp’s devil-may-care attitude that at one point gets Lady thrown in the dog pound. Tramp redeems himself by saving the baby from a rat and thereby wins Lady’s love and the affection of her human family. The first Disney animated feature filmed in CinemaScope, which necessitated extra work in planning scenes and action to fill the entire screen. World premiere in Chicago on June 16, 1955; general release on June 22, 1955. Directed by Hamilton Luske, Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson. 76 min. The idea for the film came from a short story by Ward Greene entitled, “Happy Dan, the Whistling Dog.” The film was enlivened by such songs as “He’s a Tramp” and “The Siamese Cat Song, ” by Sonny Burke and Peggy Lee. In early script versions, Tramp was first called Homer, then Rags, then Bozo. A 1940 script introduced the twin Siamese cats eventually known as Si and Am; they were then named Nip and Tuck. The film stars such voice talents as Barbara Luddy as Lady; Larry Roberts as Tramp; and Peggy Lee as Darling, the Siamese cats, and Peg, the show dog. Peggy Lee helped promote the film on the Disney television series, explaining her work with the score and singing a few numbers. Lady and the Tramp was re-released in theaters in 1962, 1971, 1980, and 1986. Released on video in 1987.",

    "long_description": "African Lion, The (film) True-Life Adventure feature, released on September 14, 1955. Directed by James Algar, with a notable musical score by Paul Smith. The photography team of Alfred and Elma Milotte spent three years in Africa studying the realm of the king of beasts, and came up with some fascinating footage of not only lions but giraffes, rhinoceroses, elephants, and baboons. The effects of a drought on the animals and the eventual tropical storms that end it round out the motion picture. The cost of film was not a major factor; the Milottes shot until they got the footage that would make an interesting film. Eventually only about six percent of the film they shot was used in the final production. The movie’s theme of the annual life cycle would years later be echoed in “The Circle of Life” in The Lion King. 72 min. See His Majesty, King of the Beasts for the abridged 1958 television airing.

Intrepid Confederates, led by the train’s conductor, William A. Fuller, commandeered rolling stock for the chase, and persevered long enough to recapture the train. Union leader James J. Andrews and many of his men were hanged in the South, but those who survived and made their way home were given Congressional Medals of Honor by the secretary of war. Released June 8, 1956. Directed by Francis D. Lyon. 87 min. Stars Fess Parker (James J. Andrews), Jeffrey Hunter (William A. Fuller), Jeff York (William Campbell), Kenneth Tobey (Anthony Murphy). Because of Walt Disney’s love of trains, he was especially enthused about this film, and he managed to secure aid from the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Museum to obtain an authentic locomotive. From the B&O he borrowed the William Mason, which doubled for the General. The Inyo, playing the Texas, was borrowed from Paramount Pictures. While the two original locomotives were still in existence, they were museum objects and not available for filming. (Both can be visited in Atlanta-area museums today.) A section of track near Clayton, Georgia, was utilized for the production. The technical adviser, Wilbur Kurtz, who had performed similar chores on Gone With the Wind, happened to be a descendant of one of the Confederates who participated in the chase. The film aired on television in two parts in 1961 as Andrews’ Raiders. See also Behind the Scenes with Fess Parker. Released on video in 1983.",

Unfortunately it is Franceska’s Chiffon who gets all the attention and credit at the end—for who would believe Wilby’s story? Released Mar. 19, 1959. Directed by Charles Barton in black and white.

Fearful of his daughter Katie&rsquo;s reaction and unwilling to give up his own standing in the community, he attempts to act as matchmaker to Michael and Katie to ensure their future. To help his plans, he captures his old friend King Brian of the leprechauns, who must grant Darby three wishes. King Brian is almost successful in furthering a romance when meddlesome Pony Sugrue, a jealous townsman, tells Katie of Michael&rsquo;s new job. In a rage, she renounces Michael and runs off after a runaway horse, only to fall and hit her head on some rocks. Near death, she is saved only when Darby diverts the dreaded Costa Bower, the Death Coach, by making his third wish to be taken instead. Inside the coach King Brian tricks Darby into making a fourth wish, which cancels out the previous ones, and sends Darby back to earth. Michael and Katie are married, and Darby is once again free to tell his tales of his little friends, the leprechauns. World premiere in Dublin, Ireland, on June 24, 1959; U.S. release on June 26, 1959. Directed by Robert Stevenson. 90 min. Based on H. T. Kavanagh&rsquo;s Darby O&rsquo;Gill stories, the film stars Albert Sharpe in the title role, with co-stars Janet Munro (Katie O&rsquo;Gill), Jimmy O&rsquo;Dea (King Brian), Sean Connery (Michael McBride), Estelle Winwood (Sheelah), Kieron Moore (Pony Sugrue), Walter Fitzgerald (Lord Fitzpatrick). With this film Janet Munro was signed to a Studio contract, but for Connery it would be three years before stardom would come with the James Bond series. The movie was director Stevenson&rsquo;s first major production, and on the strength of this assignment, he went on to direct many of the Studio&rsquo;s biggest hits in the 1960s. The film&rsquo;s production at the Studio began in the mid-1940s when Walt Disney discovered the stories, and in 1946 he sent artists to Ireland for background material, following himself soon afterward. He had a fondness for the country because his ancestors had come from there. The songs &ldquo;The Wishing Song&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pretty Irish Girl&rdquo; were written by Oliver Wallace and Lawrence E. Watkin. With the aid of lavish matte shots, the film was shot entirely in California. To film the forced perspective of the leprechauns&rsquo; throne room, there was a need for huge sets, lit by many banks of lights, necessitating the building of an entire new soundstage at the Disney Studio. Special effects masters Peter Ellenshaw, Eustace Lycett, and Joshua Meador concocted the magic of the leprechauns and their appeal was undeniable. Leprechaun means &ldquo;little body&rdquo; in Gaelic, and according to legend they are 21 inches tall, usually dressed in grass green, 5,000 years old, and immeasurably wealthy. Walt Disney dedicated the film, in the opening credits, to these very believable Little People: &ldquo;My thanks to King Brian of Knocknasheega and his leprechauns whose gracious cooperation made this picture possible.&rdquo; The movie features one of the scariest scenes ever to appear in a Disney movie&mdash;the wail of the hideous Banshee and the arrival of the dreaded Costa Bower. A television show to promote the film, I Captured the King of the Leprechauns , starred Walt Disney and Pat O&rsquo;Brien. The motion picture was reissued in 1969 and 1977. Released on video in 1981 and 1992. Dapper Dans, The Dark Water (film)",

Despite his inexperience, he is chosen to scale the mountain with Winter, his Uncle Lerner, and Saxo, a guide from a rival village. Rudi, sure his father had discovered a route to the summit, wins permission to climb a deep cleft, bringing the others behind. He succeeds, and the climb goes on. Near the top Rudi must master his desire to reach the summit in order to save Saxo from death. Winter and Lerner make the top, and plant Joseph Matt&rsquo;s revered red shirt and alpenstock like a banner atop the now conquered mountain. &nbsp;Released November 10, 1959. Directed by Ken Annakin. 107 min. Stars James MacArthur (Rudi Matt), Michael Rennie (Capt. John Winter), Janet Munro (Lizbeth Hempel), James Donald (Franz Lerner), Herbert Lom (Emil Saxo). Walt Disney&rsquo;s interest at the time in Switzerland (he took his family there on summer vacation) not only brought about this &lsquo;Tom Sawyer in the Alps\" ( Time magazine), but later, the popular Matterhorn Bobsleds attraction at Disneyland. Aired on television in two parts in 1963 as Banner in the Sky , which was the name of the original book by James Ramsey Ullman. (Ullman happened to be vacationing in Zermatt at the foot of the Matterhorn while the film was being made, and the director gave him a cameo role as an American tourist, as he did with revered actress Helen Hayes, MacArthur's mother.)

With her &ldquo;Glad Game&rdquo; she intrigues Mr. Pendergast, an old hermit, who shows the kids his glass prisms and eventually decides to adopt orphan Jimmy Bean; coaxes Mrs. Snow, a crotchety hypochondriac, from her sickbed; teaches the Reverand Ford to stand up for himself; and reinstills a romance between Aunt Polly and Dr. Edmund Chilton. Under the girl&rsquo;s influence, the town resists Aunt Polly, and stages its own benefit for building a new orphanage. Pollyanna is severely injured in trying to join the festivities, with the accident giving Aunt Polly a whole new outlook. It wins her the goodwill of the town and the love of the doctor who will restore Pollyanna&rsquo;s health.&nbsp; Directed by David Swift. Released May 19, 1960. 134 min. Stars Hayley Mills (Pollyanna), Jane Wyman (Aunt Polly), Richard Egan (Dr. Edmund Chilton), Karl Malden (Rev. Paul Ford), Agnes Moorehead (Mrs. Snow), Nancy Olsen (Nancy Furman), Adolphe Menjou (Mr. Pendergast), Donald Crisp (Mayor Karl Warren), Kevin Corcoran (Jimmy Bean). This was Hayley Mills&rsquo;s first film for Disney, and she immediately became the Studio&rsquo;s newest star. She won an Academy Award for the most outstanding juvenile performance of 1960. Wyman and Moorehead had earlier appeared together in Johnny Belinda , a film for which each was nominated for Academy Awards&mdash;Wyman won the Oscar. Based on the book by Eleanor H. Porter, published in 1913, which became perhaps the best-known American novel since Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin . It was so popular that the word Pollyanna even got into everyday usage, and eventually the dictionary, meaning someone who looks for the best in things. The film was director Swift&rsquo;s first Disney feature, and, in fact he appears briefly as the fireman scolding Jimmy Bean. With a then lavish $2.5 million budget, Swift gathered a crew and cast unlike any other Disney live-action feature. Disney set decorator Emile Kuri was on hand, but outsiders Walter Plunkett (costumes), Russell Harlan (cinematographer), and art directors Carroll Clark and Robert Clatworthy came from established careers at other studios. To find a house to use as the residence of Aunt Polly, Walt Disney had to go far afield from his Studio in Burbank. An ideal house was found in Santa Rosa, near the famed Napa Valley. It occupied a full block in the center of the town, and was surrounded by spacious lawns and gardens. It was built in 1877 as a replica of an old Natchez, Mississippi, antebellum house. The vintage train station and water hole were also filmed in Santa Rosa, but the interiors were completed at the Disney Studio. The film was released on video in 1982 and 1993.

With great courage and ingenuity, they use the salvage from the wreck to build a home in a huge tree, raise food, and protect themselves from a raiding band of pirates. The rescue of the granddaughter of a sea captain from pirates precipitates the ultimate attack by the buccaneers. The furious battle is almost won by the brigands when her grandfather’s ship arrives and routs the attackers. The romance between the eldest Robinson boy and the granddaughter culminates in their marriage. The new couple and much of the family decide to stay on the island paradise, but scholarly brother Ernst decides to go back on the ship to civilization. Released on December 21, 1960. Directed by Ken Annakin. 126 min. Stars John Mills (Father), Dorothy McGuire (Mother), James MacArthur (Fritz), Tommy Kirk (Ernst), Kevin Corcoran (Francis), Janet Munro (Roberta), Sessue Hayakawa (Pirate chief). The film was based on the book by Johann Wyss, written to preserve the tales he and his sons made up while imagining themselves in Robinson Crusoe’s predicament. Not originally intended for publication, the narrative was later edited and illustrated by Wyss’s descendants. Filmed on the Caribbean island of Tobago, the motion picture’s lavish preproduction planning and on-location shooting (22 weeks) resulted in a budget that exceeded $4 million, but the extraordinary box office returns, subsequent popular reissues in 1969, 1972, 1975, 1981, and a release on home video in 1982 has made it one of Disney’s top-grossing films. The creation of an intriguing tree house, matching the one in the movie, through which guests can climb in the Disney parks, has increased and perpetuated the popularity of the film.",

Soon Perdita produces 15 puppies, which the evil Cruella De Vil arranges to have kidnapped in her quest to make a fabulous Dalmatian-fur coat, also gathering many other puppies in order to accomplish her aim. Helped by the Twilight Bark, whereby dogs throughout the city and the countryside pass along the word of the missing puppies by barking, Pongo and Perdita go into action and locate 99 stolen puppies in Cruella’s sinister-looking home, Hell Hall. Pongo, Perdita, and the puppies manage to escape and through various ruses elude the pursuing Cruella. Cruella and her henchmen, Horace and Jasper Badun, get their just desserts. Roger and Anita adopt the puppies, and with their new family of 101 Dalmatians and Nanny to look after them, plan to build a “Dalmatian Plantation” and live happily ever after. Released on January 25, 1961. Directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, Hamilton Luske, Clyde Geronimi. Based on the book by Dodie Smith. The songs “Cruella De Ville (sic),” “Dalmatian Plantation, ” and “Kanine Krunchies Commercial” were written by Mel Leven. Costing $4 million, the film did phenomenal business on its original release, and in its subsequent reissues in 1969, 1979, 1985, and 1991. Released on video in 1992. It was the first feature to solely use the Xerox process for transferring the animators’ drawings to cels. Prior to this, each one of the animators’ drawings had to be hand traced in ink onto a cel. The new process sped up production greatly, especially in a film that had so many dogs, and not just dogs, but spotted dogs. It would have been horribly time-consuming to hand-ink each of the cels. Voice actors include Rod Taylor (Pongo), Betty Lou Gerson (Cruella de Vil), Lisa Davis (Anita), Ben Wright (Roger), and Cate Bauer (Perdita). 79 min. The famous Twilight Bark, used to rescue the puppies, was later adopted as the name for the newsletter for Disney Feature Animation. Note the spelling of Dalmatians. This word is probably the most-misspelled Disney word, with most people misspelling it “Dalmations.” Dalmatia, however, is a place, so people, and dogs, from there are Dalmatians.",

But although he loses his girl to rival Professor Shelby Ashton, his absent-mindedness pays off with the creation of Flubber, a rubbery substance with an antigravity agent. With his new invention he is able to make the puny Medfield basketball team win against Rutland College, prevent a crook, Alonzo Hawk, from stealing Flubber, and win back Betsy, flying on a Flubberized Model T to Washington to give the powerful creation to a grateful government. Released on March 16, 1961. Directed by Robert Stevenson in black and white. 96 min. Stars Fred MacMurray (Ned Brainard), Nancy Olson (Betsy Carlisle), Keenan Wynn (Alonzo Hawk), Ed Wynn (Fire Chief), Tommy Kirk (Biff Hawk), Leon Ames (Rufus Daggett), Edward Andrews (Defense Secretary), and Elliott Reid (Shelby Ashton). The special effects were created by Robert A. Mattey and Eustace Lycett, who were nominated for an Academy Award, and included the sodium screen matte process, as well as miniatures and wire-supported mockups. The film’s “Medfield Fight Song” was written by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman, their first song for a Disney feature. The motion picture, made on a small budget, did fine business at the box office, led to a sequel, Son of Flubber, and had theatrical reissues in 1967 and 1974. Released on video in black and white in 1981 and 1993, and in a colorized version in 1986, after an airing on The Disney Channel in March of that year. This was the first Disney film to be colorized, but the process was still in its infancy and the results were less than spectacular. In 1988-89, two television episodes based on the film were produced, starring Harry Anderson. See also: Flubber.",

Atencio) and the song “The Parent Trap” sung by Annette Funicello and Tommy Sands, the film introduces twins Sharon and Susan, who were separated as children by their divorced parents, and who accidentally meet during a summer at Camp Inch. Determined never to be separated again, the sisters decide to bring their parents, Mitch and Maggie, back together again. In this they have a rival, the devious Vicky, who wants to marry Mitch for his money. But after a fateful camping trip, Vicky finds living with the twins is not worth it and flees, leaving Mitch and Maggie to reunite happily. Released on June 21, 1961. Directed by David Swift. 129 min. Starring Hayley Mills in the dual role of both sisters. The careful use of double-exposure and split-screen shots, as well as a double for Hayley Mills, provided the illusion of the twins. With Maureen O’Hara (Maggie McKendrick), Brian Keith (Mitch Evers), Charlie Ruggles (Charles McKendrick), Joanna Barnes (Vicky Robinson), Una Merkel (Verbena), Leo G. Carroll (Rev. Mosby). Oscar nominations were awarded for Sound by Robert O. Cook, and for Film Editing by Philip W. Anderson. Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman provided the songs, which, besides the title song, included “For Now, For Always,” and “Let’s Get Together,” and these too added to the film’s enormous popularity. The film was shot mostly in California at various locales, including millionaire Stuyvesant Fish’s 5,200-acre ranch in Carmel, Monterey’s Pebble Beach golf course, and the studio’s Golden Oak Ranch in Placerita Canyon, where Mitch’s ranch was built. It was the design of this set that proved the most popular, and to this day the Walt Disney Archives receives requests for plans of the home’s interior design, but there, of course, never was such a house; the set was simply various rooms built on a soundstage. The film was re-released theatrically in 1968, and released on video in 1984 and 1992. The Studio later produced three television sequels starring Hayley Mills.",

And when old Jock dies of exposure a few days later, it is Bobby who travels unseen under the coffin as his friend is taken to be buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard, and keeps vigil over the grave. Nothing the caretaker, James Brown, can do prevents the little dog from getting back into the kirkyard, and eventually he stops trying as Bobby wins his heart, as well as the hearts of the poor children in the tenements nearby. The day comes when Bobby is picked up for lack of a dog license. Mr. and Mrs. Brown, and a band of children come to pay the fine, telling the Lord Provost Bobby’s story. He not only gives Bobby a license with his own hands, he also grants him the Freedom of the City, an honor bestowed only on the brave and faithful. Released on July 17, 1961. Directed by Don Chaffey. Based on a true story, as told by Eleanor Atkinson. 91 min. Stars Donald Crisp (James Brown), Laurence Naismith (Mr. Traill), Alex MacKenzie (Old Jock), Kay Walsh (Mrs. Brown). Filmed on location in Scotland. The film received favorable reviews, but the Scottish accents were hard on Americans’ ears, so the film very soon appeared on Walt Disney’s Wonderful World of Color for a television airing in 1964. Today a visitor to Edinburgh is often surprised to see a statue near the entrance to Greyfriars Kirkyard honoring the devoted Greyfriars Bobby. Released on video in 1986.",

The special effects, for many people the true highlight of the film, were by Eustace Lycett, Robert Mattey, Joshua Meador, Bill Justice, and X. Atencio.

When the knights marvel at the wondrous sword, and question where he got it, Wart has to prove himself all over again, and again he pulls the sword from the stone.&nbsp; Wart is proclaimed king by the marveling warriors. Wart as King Arthur is apprehensive of his ability to govern, but Merlin returns to reassure him. Released on December 25, 1963. Directed by Wolfgang Reitherman. Based on the book by T. H. White. 79 min. Features the voices of Ricky Sorensen (Wart), Sebastian Cabot (Narrator), Karl Swenson (Merlin), Junius Matthews (Archimedes), Norman Alden (Sir Kay), Martha Wentworth (Madam Mim, Granny Squirrel, Scullery Maid). The film marked Wolfgang Reitherman&rsquo;s first solo directorial effort for a feature film. The movie is somewhat dated, being filled with 1960s references, but it has some wonderful moments, especially the highly imaginative Wizard&rsquo;s Duel. The songs, including &ldquo;A Most Befuddling Thing,&rdquo; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s What Makes the World Go Round,&rdquo; &ldquo;Higitus Figitus,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Legend of the Sword in the Stone,&rdquo; were written by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman. The motion picture was re-released theatrically in 1972 and 1983, and inspired the Sword in the Stone ceremony at the Disney theme parks. Released on video in 1986.

Possessing an extremely high IQ, he is head and shoulders above his fellow classmates, particularly in the field of scientific endeavor. Although admonished by his professor to proceed slowly, he is already applying the results of his research to not only the problems confronting the college, but also to assist some of his fellow students. His efforts as a do-gooder boomerang on all concerned, but eventually everything works out. The application of Merlin&rsquo;s meager knowledge of extrasensory perception and hypnotism results in some way-out hilarious involvements. Released on January 22, 1964.

Loomis), Alan Hewitt (Prof. Shattuck), Connie Gilchrist (Mrs. Gossett). Features a musical hit for Annette in the form of the title song written by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman.

    "long_description": "Tiger Walks, A (film) A drunken truck driver accidentally permits a mistreated tiger to escape from captivity while the circus wagon is undergoing repairs in a small country town garage. This animal, never out of captivity, escapes into the countryside, hungry, frightened, and incapable of coping with this new way of life. Julie, the young daughter of the local sheriff, realizes that the gathering hordes of local hunters, the Army, and her father&rsquo;s deputies will kill the tiger, who does not belong in the wilds but back in captivity. She succeeds in winning over her father, who decides to send for a tranquilizer gun located in a nearby city in an effort to capture the animal peacefully before it is killed by an aroused and panic-stricken community. In the end, the animal is spared and returned to the only life it knows, at the local zoo. Released on March 12, 1964. Directed by Norman Tokar. 91 min. Stars Brian Keith (Pete Williams), Vera Miles (Dorothy Williams), Pamela Franklin (Julie Williams), Sabu (Ram Singh), Kevin Corcoran (Tom Hadley), Peter Brown (Vern Goodman). One of the highlights of this film is the truly extraordinary supporting cast, which featured such favorites as Una Merkel (Mrs. Watkins), Connie Gilchrist (Lewis&rsquo; wife), Frank McHugh (Bill Watkins), Edward Andrews (Governor), Doodles Weaver (Bob Evans), Jack Albertson (Sam Grant), Arthur Hunnicutt (Lewis), and Hal Peary (Uncle Harry). This was Sabu&rsquo;s last film role. With sets built at the Disney Studio in Burbank, things got a little exciting during filming when at one point the trained tiger leapt through a sheet of plate glass that had been placed between him and the camera. But the trainers soon had him back under control before anyone was injured. Because of the serious subject matter and the unflattering look at small-town life, the film was only moderately successful. Released on video in 1986. Tiger Trouble (film) Tigger",

The proper English father is too preoccupied with his responsibility at the bank; the mother, an ardent suffragette, is not really aware that their two children, left in the care of one nanny after another, are unhappy and unable to communicate with the parents they truly love. Mary Poppins has come to change all this. She settles into the house, and soon has everyone wrapped around her little finger. Mary, along with her friend Bert and a host of chimney sweeps, teaches the children how to have fun, and in so doing makes the Banks household a happier place. By the time she opens her umbrella and flies off on a beautiful spring evening, the family is united together in the park, flying a kite. General release on August 29, 1964. Directed by Robert Stevenson. 139 min. This famed Disney masterwork is indeed &ldquo;practically perfect&rdquo; in every way from its cast&ndash;Julie Andrews (Mary Poppins), Dick Van Dyke (Bert), David Tomlinson (George Banks), Glynis Johns (Mrs. Banks), Ed Wynn (Uncle Albert), Hermione Baddeley (Ellen), Karen Dotrice (Jane), Matthew Garber (Michael), Elsa Lanchester (Katie Nanna), Arthur Treacher (Constable Jones), Reginald Owen (Admiral Boom), Reta Shaw (Mrs. Brill), Jane Darwell (bird woman)&ndash;to its lavish musical score and delightful songs provided by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman which includes such favorites as &ldquo;A Spoonful of Sugar, &rdquo; &ldquo;Feed the Birds, &rdquo; &ldquo;Jolly Holiday, &rdquo; &ldquo;Sister Suffraggette, &rdquo; &ldquo;The Life I Lead, &rdquo; &ldquo;Step in Time, &rdquo; &ldquo;Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, &rdquo; and &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Go Fly a Kite.&rdquo; The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences agreed too, giving it 13 nominations from which it won five Oscars for Best Actress (Julie Andrews), Best Song (&ldquo;Chim Chim Cher-ee&rdquo;), Best Music Score (the Sherman brothers), Best Film Editing (Cotton Warburton), and Best Special Visual Effects (Peter Ellenshaw, Eustace Lycett, and Hamilton Luske). There was also a special Scientific award to Petro Vlahos, Wadsworth E. Pohl, and Ub Iwerks for the creation and application to use of Color Traveling Matte Composite Cinematography, which helped make possible the combination of live action with animated actors in the film. The special-effects work on Mary Poppins was the most challenging the studio had ever known. Everything from the two-strip sodium process and piano wire to bungee cords were used to create the magical sequences. The work of the special-effects crew, as well as all the production staff, was the culmination of years of Disney innovation. In fact, only Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood, the choreographers, and Irwin Kostal, musical arranger, had to be brought in from the outside; Disney staff members could be called upon for all of the other tasks. The entire film was shot on soundstages at the Disney Studio in Burbank. A lavish premiere at Grauman&rsquo;s Chinese Theater on August 27, 1964, began its fabulous box office run that made it Disney&rsquo;s most successful feature until then. P. L. Travers, author of the popular books on which the film is based, continued writing new adventures for Mary Poppins long after the film, and in the late 1980s worked with a Disney screenwriter on a film sequel that never materialized. Reissued theatrically in 1973 and 1980; released on video in 1980 and kept available continuously. In 2004 a stage adaptation of Mary Poppins opened in England.

Using the money his son earned as a fur trapper, Calloway buys a lake and plants it with corn to attract the migrating birds. Learning that two rascally operators want the lake as a resort site, Calloway sets his corn afire, and then is shot by one of the operators. Later, with the area declared a sanctuary by officials, Calloway is able to see his dream realized when the geese come to the lake. Released on January 28, 1965. Directed by Norman Tokar. 131 min.

The cast includes Linda Evans as Bridie Mellott in one of her first film appearances. Most of the film takes place during the fall folliage season. After beautiful establishing shots were filmed in Vermont, some extra work was needed to turn the Disney Studio backlot, where the lake, Calloway cabin, and village were created, into a similar setting. Since California is not known for its fall colors, 280,000 handpainted leaves and bushes had to be meticulously prepared to match the Vermont scenes. The film marked the only time the prominent film composer Max Steiner, of Gone With The Wind and Casablanca fame, produced a score for Disney. There were also two songs, &ldquo;The Cabin-Raising Song&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rhyme-Around,&rdquo; written by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman.&nbsp; Released on video in 1985.

Drexel Biddle, and his unusual Philadephia family, seen through the eyes of their new to the U.S. Irish butler. The year is 1916, and in the busy household on Rittenhouse Square each of the family members has hopes and dreams. For Mr. Biddle it is strengthening the &ldquo;Biddle Bible Class, &rdquo; campaigning for military preparedness, and caring for his prized alligators. For daughter Cordelia Biddle, it is first love with the wealthy Angie Duke, who is infatuated with the automobile. For Mrs. Biddle it is keeping order in the family despite frozen alligators, a wedding, confrontations with the Duke family, World War I, and comforting her husband when the children have left home.&nbsp; Premiered in Hollywood on June 23, 1967. Directed by Norman Tokar. 159 min. (164 min. with overtures) for the original roadshow version; 144 min. for the stereo general release; 141 min. for the mono general release.&nbsp; Stars Fred MacMurray (Anthony J. Drexel Biddle), Tommy Steele (John Lawless), Lesley Ann Warren (Cordelia Drexel Biddle). John Davidson (Angie Duke), Greer Garson (as Mrs. Biddle in her last feature film role), Geraldine Page (Mrs. Duke), Gladys Cooper (Aunt Mary), Hermione Baddeley (Mrs. Worth), Paul Petersen (Tony), Eddie Hodges (Liv), and Joyce Bulifant (Rosemary). This was the Disney Studio&rsquo;s most lavish and starry musical production since Mary Poppins . The Sherman brothers, Richard and Robert, wrote twelve songs, including &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Always Be Irish, &rdquo; &ldquo;Detroit, &rdquo; &ldquo;Fortuosity, &rdquo; &ldquo;Watch Your Footwork, &rdquo; &ldquo;Valentine Candy, &rdquo; &ldquo;There Are Those, &rdquo; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Have A Drink On It, &rdquo; and &ldquo;Strengthen The Dwelling.&rdquo; The film was heavily edited during its release due to the Studio&rsquo;s disappointment that the film did not equal Mary Poppins&rsquo; &nbsp;success. Cut footage from the original 159 min. roadshow version and the stereophonic sound track were restored and a heretofore unseen musical number, &ldquo;It Won&rsquo;t Be Long &lsquo;Til Christmas, &rdquo; sung by Greer Garson and Fred MacMurray, was added for a Disney Channel airing in November 1984, though some dialogue preceding the song was still missing. The film has many highlights, from Tommy Steele, Fred MacMurray, and Greer Garson&rsquo;s portrayals, to a pair of mischievous alligators who dance with Steele. Some exhilarating dance numbers, including a riotous barroom sequence, were staged by Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood. The film&rsquo;s origins date back to the published true story of the Biddles, written by Cordelia Drexel Biddle and Kyle Crichton, which was subsequently made into a successful Broadway comedy.&nbsp; A J Carothers adapted the screenplay when Walt Disney enlisted the Sherman brothers to make it into a musical event. There were other contenders for the role of Mr. Biddle, including Rex Harrison, who was favored by the Sherman brothers, Burt Lancaster, and Brian Keith, but Walt Disney chose his favorite, Fred MacMurray, whom he had wanted from the beginning.

In the process, they persevere and mature. And, after “bringing the law to Jackson’s Hole,” they face a happier future. Released on January 20, 1971. Directed by Robert Totten. 100 min. Stars Steve Forrest (Jim), Jack Elam (Thompson), Ron Howard (Virgil), Frank de Kova (Two Dog), Morgan Woodward (Ab), Vera Miles (Kate), Clint Howard (Andrew), Dub Taylor (Phil). This film marked the first time in a theatrical film that three members of the Howard family acted together—father, Rance, and sons, Ron and Clint. Based on the book Little Britches by Ralph Moody, the movie was filmed almost in its entirety in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the original locale of the story. The diverse scenery provided all the needed locations for the seven-week exterior shooting schedule. Only one day of inclement weather sent the Disney company to a covered set erected in a barn. The spectacular twister that plagues the pioneer family was manufactured by seven wind machines from the Disney Studio in Burbank, assisted by three snowplanes from Jackson Hole. Together they stirred up dark clouds of dust that could be seen for thirty miles. For the drought sequence, 80 acres of green alfalfa had to be browned with a mixture of white paint, yellow vegetable dye, and chocolate dye, plus the necessary paint thinners. “And to get it we cleaned out all the paint stores in Jackson and Idaho Falls, and an entire paint factory in Salt Lake City,” said production designer Robert Clatworthy.

    "long_description": "Bedknobs and Broomsticks (film) In the autumn of 1940, an eccentric, ladylike spinster, Eglantine Price, becomes an apprentice witch, in hopes of finding a magic formula which will help England win the war against Nazi Germany. With the help of three London children, who she takes in to save them from the blitz, she first seeks out her amusing but bogus professor of witchcraft, Emelius Browne, and then ventures into Portobello Road in search of the rare formula. Miss Price finally discovers that the words of the magical spell can be found on the legendary “Lost Isle of Naboombu,” so she, Browne, and the children travel there, having adventures beneath the sea along the way. They discover the lion king of Naboombu is wearing a medallion with the words to the spell on it, which they have to obtain. All of this magical travel is possible with the aid of a magical bedknob. Returning home, Miss Price uses the formula to raise a ghostly army of armor from the local museum that routs a band of invading German commandos. Premiered in England on October 7, 1971; U.S. general release on December 13, 1971. Directed by Robert Stevenson. 117 min. for the original release version; whittled down to 98 min. for a 1979 reissue. Stars Angela Lansbury (Eglantine Price), Roddy McDowall (Mr. Jelk), David Tomlinson (Emelius Browne), Sam Jaffe (Bookman), John Ericson (Col. Heller), Bruce Forsyth (Swinburne), Tessie O’Shea (Mrs. Hobday), Reginald Owen (Gen. Teagler), Ian Weighill (Charlie), Roy Snart (Paul), Cindy O’Callaghan (Carrie). The creative talent behind Mary Poppins joined forces again for this film, including producer-writer Bill Walsh, director Robert Stevenson, songwriters Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman, music supervisor Irwin Kostal, art director Peter Ellenshaw, and special effects technician Eustace Lycett. The songs included: “The Old Home Guard,” “Eglantine,” “The Age of Not Believing,” “Portobello Road,” “The Beautiful Briny,” and “Substitutiary Locomotion.” One song sung by Angela Lansbury on the sound track record album, “A Step in the Right Direction,” was edited out of the film just before its release. The screenplay was based on Mary Norton’s book, with additions by Bill Walsh, who came up with the German invasion. The film was made entirely on the Disney Studio lot in Burbank, California, where outdoor sets included the town of Pepperinge Eye and Miss Price’s seaview cottage, and indoor sets including a three-block section of London’s legendary Portobello Road. Two hundred players jammed this set alone, which was filled with bric-a-brac and such oddments as a Sicilian sedan chair, Limoges china, and gas masks from World War II. Among the performers and extras in the crowd were veterans of music halls, vaudeville, rep shows, radio, silent films, and early talkies. The ghostly medieval army’s weapons and armor had originally been assembled in Spain for the film El Cid, and then were shipped to America to be used in the Warner Bros. musical Camelot. Ward Kimball was the director of the wonderful animation sequences on the Isle of Naboombu. Despite the effort, lavish budget, ingenuity, and special effects, the film was not a great box office success, causing the studio subsequently to edit the film. The editing was accomplished primarily to the detriment of musical numbers—large chunks of “Eglantine” and “With A Flair” were deleted. Academy Award winner for Best Special Visual Effects. The movie was nominated also for Best Art Direction/Set Direction, Best Song (“The Age of Not Believing”), Best Scoring, and Best Costume Design. The film remains a Disney favorite today, with a theatrical reissue in 1979 and releases on video in 1980, 1985, and 1989.",

    "long_description": "World’s Greatest Athlete, The (film) Discovered in Africa by two U.S. college sports coaches, Nanu, a blond boy raised by natives after the death of his missionary parents, is an incredible athlete. Entered in a Los Angeles NCAA track-and-field competition, he wins all the events despite voodoo magic being used against him. Released on February 1, 1973. Directed by Robert Scheerer. 92 min. Stars Tim Conway (Milo), Jan-Michael Vincent (Nanu), John Amos (Coach Archer), Roscoe Lee Browne (Gazenga), Dayle Haddon (Jane), Billy De Wolfe (Maxwell), Nancy Walker (Mrs. Peterson), Danny Goldman (Leopold Maxwell). Bill Toomey, a world and Olympic decathlon champion, acted as a technical adviser to the film crew. The film also included sportscaster favorites Howard Cosell, Bud Palmer, Frank Gifford, and Jim McKay. For one scene in which a 3-inch-tall Tim Conway, under a spell by Nanu’s witch-doctor godfather, falls into a lady’s handbag, Disney propmakers fashioned a number of giant props: lipstick, compact, hairpins, needle and thread, safety pins, reading glasses, comb and brush, pills, keys, and matches. Ordinary items, but these particular ones were 24 times normal size, weighed 1 ton, and cost over $15,000. In other scenes, Conway encountered many other giant props; a huge telephone cost the studio $7,900. A cocktail glass was 7 feet tall and held a 1,245-gallon old-fashioned displaced by ice cubes 2 feet square. As the Disney press release quipped: “At 40 shots to a quart, consider the possibilities!” The movie was filmed at Caswell Memorial State Park, near Stockton, California, and at Lion Country Safari south of Disneyland, which doubled for Zambia. Scenes were also shot in Merrivale and Newhall, California. Released on video in 1986.",

His guardian angel, Roy Zerney, helps him to realize the error of his ways and he becomes a public hero, basking in the warmth of his family’s love and admiration, through a series of hectic events involving bootleggers and the police. Released on March 23, 1973. Directed by Vincent McEveety. 93 min. Stars Fred MacMurray (Charley Appleby), Henry Morgan (Angel), Cloris Leachman (Nettie), Kurt Russell (Ray), Kathleen Cody (Leonora), Vincent Van Patten (Willie), Scott Kolden (Rupert). This was the last of Fred MacMurray’s seven films for Disney. Buddy Baker, the film’s musical composer and conductor, utilized many golden tunes from the 1930s for the score, including “Three Little Words,” and “You’re Driving Me Crazy,” as well as an original song, “Livin’ One Day at a Time,” written by Shane Tatum and Ed Scott. To create a 1930s setting for the film, Disney art directors and set designers found the ideal location in Pasadena, California, on a quiet residential street lined with small frame bungalows. The filmmakers hid today’s television antennas, added a few stylish touring cars, dressed the cast in costume and—presto—they had recreated the 1930s. Released on video in 1986.",

While fleeing to Mexico with two camels stolen from the army, he becomes friends with Mark, a 10-year-old boy raised by Indians, who is also a fugitive. During Mark’s capture, Clint is almost hanged, but is finally set free. The pair then head for Colorado to find the attractive widow and her daughter they met during their flight from the army.

Stewart), Morgan Woodward (Sgt. Raines), John Doucette (Sgt. Waller), Jim Davis (trail boss), Jay Silverheels (Jimmy Wolf). Eleven-year-old O’Brien wanted the part so badly that he showed up for auditions in full Indian costume and black wig; only later did the director discover that Clay had blond hair. The film was shot near Kanab, Utah, which is surrounded by the Grand Canyon, Kaibab National Forest, Bryce and Zion National Parks, and Lake Powell. Cooperation was gained with the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management. The production was constantly delayed by accidents and freak mishaps: lightning struck the plane flying the cast and crew into Kanab; flooding occurred; the truck containing all the props caught fire, destroying both; Jodie Foster sprained an ankle; and stuntmen were injured in the action sequences.

Robin Hood rebels against the villainy of Prince John, and his accomplices, Sir Hiss and the Sheriff of Nottingham. Prince John has usurped the throne of King Richard, his brother, who was captured on the Crusades. With Little John, Friar Tuck, and the townspeople of Nottingham, Robin defeats the runty prince and his minions and Richard is free to return and reclaim his kingdom. Released on November 8, 1973.

In several sequences, George Bruns sought to capture the flavor of the period by using medieval instruments such as French horns and harpsichords, and occasionally just a mandolin. The Robin Hood legend has long been popular with moviemakers, from the silent version starring Douglas Fairbanks, the Errol Flynn classic of 1938, Disney&rsquo;s own live-action version The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men in 1952, Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn&rsquo;s Robin and Marian in 1976, to Kevin Costner&rsquo;s version in 1991.

The crew discover a volcanic Nordic island, a fabled whales&rsquo; graveyard, and encounter Viking warriors who are far from friendly. Sir Anthony is reunited with his son Donald whose sweetheart, Freyja, helps them escape a death decree. Recaptured after a battle with killer whales, the fugitives are finally given their freedom in exchange for an American professor remaining behind as hostage.

Based on The Lost Ones by Ian Cameron. With music composed by Maurice Jarre and spectacular special effects by Peter Ellenshaw, Art Cruickshank and Danny Lee, this lavish film was filmed on locations spanning the Arctic Circle from Alaska to Greenland to Norway.

The &ldquo;valuables&rdquo;&mdash;the Bradley orphans Bobby, 12, Clovis, 7, and Celia, 5&mdash;arrive aboard a stagecoach driven by pretty &ldquo;Dusty&rdquo; Clydesdale. Desperate, Russel tries to unload the brood, who discover a huge gold nugget in a nearby mine, causing unwelcome interest by the bumbling Hash Knife Outfit. As Russel rewards the now-famous orphans with their favorite meal of apple dumplings, the numbskull desperadoes try to steal the gold, but, as usual, are caught. However, the dangerous Stillwell gang also plans a bank heist, but are undone when the children and the Hash Knife Outfit, aided by Russel and Dusty, break into the holdup. Russel and Dusty marry, uniting the happy new family now known as &ldquo;The Apple Dumpling Gang.&rdquo; Released on July 4, 1975. Directed by Norman Tokar. 100 min. Stars Bill Bixby (Russel Donavan), Tim Conway (Amos), Don Knotts (Theodore), Susan Clark (Magnolia), David Wayne (Col. T. T. Clydesdale), Slim Pickens (Frank Stillwell), Harry Morgan (Homer McCoy), John McGiver (Leonard Sharpe), Don Knight (John Wintle), Clay O&rsquo;Brien (Bobby Bradley), Brad Savage (Clovis Bradley), Stacy Manning (Celia Bradley). The story was based on the book by Jack M. Bickham. The song &ldquo;The Apple Dumpling Gang,&rdquo; was written by Shane Tatum and sung by Randy Sparks and The Back Porch Majority. While planning the sets for the film at the Disney Studio, the set designers decided that three copies of the bank had to be built. One was indoors on a sound stage (featuring exterior and interior sets), and two matching exteriors were built outdoors on the backlot, one of them roofless and with burned beams exposed, showing the aftermath of an explosion. Location filming took place at the Tropico gold mine in Rosamond, California, and in the Los Padres and Deschutes National Forests in Oregon. The pairing of Tim Conway and Don Knotts worked so well that they were teamed in several later Disney films. The great popularity of the film spawned a sequel in 1979, The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again . Released on video in 1980, 1985, and 1992.

    "long_description": "One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing (film) Lord Southmere, a British intelligence agent, steals a piece of top secret microfilm, the Lotus X, from a Chinese warlord, and hides it in the skeleton of a dinosaur in a London museum after escaping from a Chinese agent, Hnup Wan, who soon recaptures him. Southmere has told his childhood nanny Hettie what has happened and she, aided by a small army of fellow nannies, helps foil the machinations of Hnup and his gang. Released on July 9, 1975. Directed by Robert Stevenson. 94 min. Stars Peter Ustinov (Hnup Wan), Helen Hayes (Hettie), Clive Revill (Quon), Derek Nimmo (Lord Southmere), Joan Sims (Emily), Bernard Bresslaw (Fan Choy), Natasha Pyne (Susan). The film was shot on location in London, including the London Zoo in Regent&rsquo;s Park, the Natural History Museum in Kensington, Hyde Park, and parts of Soho. The movie was based on the book The Great Dinosaur Robbery by &ldquo;David Forrest&rdquo; who was, in actuality, two authors: David Eliades and Bob Forrest Webb. Art director Michael Stringer engaged a team of six modelers who worked for two months replicating two 75-foot-long dinosaur skeletons weighing several tons, which had necks that could bob up and down during the chase sequence. Adding to the 1920s look of the film is a collection of vintage vehicles ranging from a Daimler for Hnup Wan&rsquo;s limousine to Nanny Emily&rsquo;s 1920 Godfrey-Nash cyclecar. Released on video in 1986. One More Mountain (television) One Saturday Morning (television)",

    "long_description": "Ride a Wild Pony (film) In Australia, a wild 13-year old boy, Scott Pirie, who is poor, and a haughty, crippled teenage girl named Josie Ellison who is rich, find themselves at odds over the ownership of a beloved pony. The boy calls the Welsh pony Taff and uses him to get to school, while Josie loves the pony as well for its wild spirit and names it Bo. Since she is a victim of polio, Bo allows her to get around in a pony cart. The children&rsquo;s fight for the animal leads to the courtroom where it is decided that it is up to the pony to decide who its owner should be. The pony hesitantly picks Scotty, but also comforts Josie. The Ellisons bring feed for Taff to the Pirie ranch, and Josie invites the boy and horse to visit her often in the future. They become friends, and the bond in the relationship is the pony. The first Disney feature filmed in Australia. Initial release in Los Angeles on December 25, 1975; general release on March 26, 1976. Directed by Don Chaffey. 91 min. Stars Michael Craig (James), John Meillon (Charles Quayle), Robert Bettles (Scott), Eva Griffith (Josie), Graham Rouse (Bluey), Peter Gwynne (Sgt. Collins), John Meillon Jr. (Kit Quayle), Alfred Bell (Angus Pirie), Melissa Jaffer (Mrs. Pirie). The film was based on the novel A Sporting Proposition by James Aldridge, and shot on location in Australia in Victoria and New South Wales. The ideal location for the derelict Pirie farm was found in the Horton Valley, but the nearest towns were 60 miles away, so the cast and crew were divided between Barraba and Bingara. For the Ellison ranch, the crew used the historic Belltrees, an expansive 20,000-acre country estate, which was available only after His Royal Highness Prince Charles ended his vacationing there. The small Victorian town of Chiltern was also used as the town of Barambogie, after considerable restoration of the storefronts and pouring tons of earth over the paved roads. An old K class steam locomotive and coach cars were brought out of mothballs, spruced up, and transported from Melbourne, more than 200 miles away. Most of Chiltern&rsquo;s population signed on as extras. Released on video in 1987. Ride a Northbound Horse (television) Ridgway, Charlie",

The movie was based on the book A Journey to Matecumbe by Robert Lewis Taylor. The song &ldquo;Matecumbe&rdquo; was written by Richard McKinley and Shane Tatum. Danville, Kentucky was chosen for the opening scenes, and an old 217-acre plantation estate, built around 1830, became &ldquo;Grassy.&rdquo; The Sacramento River above Colusa, California, became the Mississippi, but the actual Everglades of Florida were used as such in the film, with the cast setting up production headquarters in Kissimmee. The man-made hurricane was shot in part of a rain forest inhabited by ancient Seminole Indians and made by using giant wind machines and tons of water pumped in and blasted at the cast by airplane engines. The last night of the disaster sequence Ustinov was struck by a wave, fell, and was hospitalized with pulled ligaments in his left ankle. The company then moved to a beach at Walt Disney World, where final scenes in the picture were filmed. Released on video in 1986. Treasure Island (film) Treasure of San Bosco Reef, The (television)",

To help a young orphan, Pete, break away from his evil foster parents, the Gogans, and find a happy home with Nora and her father Lampie in their lighthouse, Elliott must avoid the clutches of the greedy Dr. Terminus, who wants to exploit him. Premiered on November 3, 1977; general release on December 16, 1977. Directed by Don Chaffey. 135 min. Stars Helen Reddy (Nora), Mickey Rooney (Lampie), Jim Dale (Dr. Terminus), Red Buttons (Hoagy), Shelley Winters (Lena Gogan), Sean Marshall (Pete), Jane Kean (Miss Taylor), Jim Backus (Mayor), Charles Tyner (Merle), Gary Morgan (Grover), Jeff Conaway (Willie), Cal Bartlett (Paul), and featuring the voice of Charlie Callas as Elliott the dragon. This was internationally known vocalist Helen Reddy&rsquo;s first starring role, and the film debut of Sean Marshall, as Pete, who went on to provide the voice for the boy in The Small One . The musical score was written by Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn and included &ldquo;Candle on the Water,&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Not Easy,&rdquo; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Room For Everyone,&rdquo; &ldquo;Brazzle Dazzle Day,&rdquo; &ldquo;In These Hills,&rdquo; &ldquo;Every Little Piece,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Passamaschloddy.&rdquo; Animation art director Ken Anderson, animation director Don Bluth, and effects animator Dorse A. Lanpher were responsible for the ebullient animated dragon and his memorable interactions with the live actors. The story originated from writers Seton I. Miller and S. S. Field, who brought the property to Disney, where it was purchased years earlier, but it was not until 1975 that producer Jerome Courtland asked screenwriter Malcolm Marmorstein to adapt a screenplay. The Passamaquoddy town square and wharf area was constructed on the Disney Burbank Studio lot partly from the old Western set. Jack Martin Smith, the art director, face-lifted 30 existing buildings and constructed 8 more, with interiors designed on the Disney soundstages. The lighthouse for the film was built on a point above Morro Bay, California, substituting for Maine. It was equipped with a large Fresnell-type lighthouse lens, with a wickstand inside that caused a beacon of from 18 to 24 miles. In fact, it worked so well that Disney had to get special permission from the Coast Guard to operate it, since its operation would have confused passing ships. The domestic gross on the film&rsquo;s initial release was $18 million, a disappointment to the Disney Studio, which had hoped for another Mary Poppins success. The movie was nominated for Best Original Song (&ldquo;Candle on the Water&rdquo;) and Best Original Song Score, by Al Kasha, Joel Hirschhorn, and Irwin Kostal. Because of the disappointing box office, the film was cut from its original 135 minutes to 129 minutes during its initial run. A reissue appeared in 1984 that was edited further to 106 minutes.

Palomino is returning to Earth after a fruitless 18-month search for extraterrestrial life when the crew comes upon a supposedly lost ship, the magnificent U.S.S. Cygnus , hovering near a Black Hole. The ship is controlled by Dr. Hans Reinhardt and his monstrous robot companion, Maximillian. But the initial wonderment and awe the Palomino crew have for the ship, and its resistance to the power of the Black Hole, turns to horror as they uncover Reinhardt&rsquo;s plans, which involve turning his former crew into robots and flying through the Hole. As they try to escape, a meteorite shower damages the ship, and the survivors hang on as they are plunged into the most powerful force in the universe, heading toward the blinding light that holds whatever eternity awaits them.

The plane crash-lands on a small island inhabited by two World War II Japanese naval officers who don&rsquo;t know the war is over. After some confusion, they all end up friends. Converting the plane into a boat, everyone sets sail for Hawaii. After several adventures, they are rescued by the Coast Guard. The pilot and the missionary, with plans to adopt the orphans, are married by the captain. Released on June 25, 1980. Directed by Charles Jarrott. 98 min. Stars Elliott Gould (Noah Dugan), Genevieve Bujold (Bernadette), Ricky Schroder (Bobby), Tammy Lauren (Julie), Vincent Gardenia (Stoney), John Fujioka (Cleveland), Yuki Shimoda (Hiro), John P. Ryan (Coslough), Dana Elcar (Benchley). The film was based on a story by Ernest K. Gann. The movie&rsquo;s song, &ldquo;Half of Me&rdquo; was written by Hal David and Maurice Jarre, and performed by Alexandra Brown. Location shooting took place at a dilapidated airfield in the desert near Victorville, California, and on the island of Kauai in Hawaii. For the scene in which the B-29 crashes into the sand, twenty-two artificial palms were shipped from California to protect the island&rsquo;s ecology. The interior of the plane and many night scenes were filmed on Disney soundstages, and for the underwater scenes, the soundstage tank built for 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea was utilized. Five B-29&rsquo;s were used in the film, but only one could fly. The others were gathered from remote areas in various dismantled and decaying forms to be rejuvenated, with two sent to the Studio and two sent to Hawaii for an excruciatingly difficult rejuvenation process. The U.S. Navy had some rigging and instrumentation on hand; additional equipment was purchased from outside sources, and the rest had to be painstakingly tooled by Disney craftsmen. Besides the human cast, 2 goats, 6 pigs, 5 sheep, 20 chickens, 4 rabbits, 2 grey geese, 4 white ducks, a mallard duck, a cow, and 2 bulls comprised the film&rsquo;s animal cast.

    "long_description": "Fox and the Hound, The (film) The animated story of two friends who didn&rsquo;t know they were supposed to be enemies. Tod, an orphaned baby fox, raised by Widow Tweed, is best friends with Copper, a young hunting dog. When they grow up, Copper learns to hunt and discovers he must pursue his friend. Tod is taken to a game preserve for safety, and there he falls in love with Vixey, a beautiful female fox. Copper and his master hunt Tod in the preserve, but when the chips are down, Tod and Copper realize that their friendship overcomes all. Released on July 10, 1981. Directed by Art Stevens, Ted Berman, and Richard Rich. 83 min. Featuring the voices of Mickey Rooney (older Tod), Keith Mitchell (young Tod), Kurt Russell (older Copper), Corey Feldman (young Copper), Pearl Bailey (Big Mama), Pat Buttram (Chief), Sandy Duncan (Vixey), Dick Bakalyan (Dinky), Paul Winchell (Boomer), Jack Albertson (Amos Slade), and Jeanette Nolan (Widow Tweed), the film is based on a story by Daniel P. Mannix. The feature film marked the premier effort of a new generation of Disney animators who would, in a few years create The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast . With the exception of some early scenes and character development done by veteran animators Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston and Cliff Nordberg, this film represented the combined talent and imagination of a new team. Production on The Fox and the Hound began in the spring of 1977, but it was delayed by the defection from the animation department of Don Bluth, Gary Goldman, John Pomeroy, and an additional group of animators who were unhappy at the Disney Studio and eager to set up their own studio and produce movies that they felt were more in line with the style and quality of movies that Disney used to make in its golden years. By the time The Fox and the Hound was finished, four years later, it would require approximately 360,000 drawings, 110,000 painted cels, 1,100 painted backgrounds, and a total of 180 people, including 24 animators. As in all Disney animated outings, music served to accentuate the action, highlight the humor, and, in general, enhance the story. The movie features the songs &ldquo;Best of Friends,&rdquo; by Richard O. Johnston, son of animator Ollie Johnston, and Stan Fidel; &ldquo;Lack of Education,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Huntin&rsquo; Man,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Appreciate The Lady&rdquo; by Jim Stafford; and &ldquo;Goodbye May Seem Forever&rdquo; by Richard Rich and Jeffrey Patch. The film was an enormous box office success. The film was re-released theatrically in 1988. Released on video in 1994.

Woody is asked by a CIA-agent friend to deliver diplomatic papers to a Russian agent with whom he falls in love, and when she offers to defect, he bumbles through a series of exciting and comic chases in trying to save her from the KGB. First released in England on July 2, 1981; U.S. release on August 7, 1981. Directed by Charles Jarrott. 90 min. Stars Michael Crawford (Woody Wilkins), Oliver Reed (Krokov), Barbara Carerra (Natalia), James Hampton (Harry), Jean-Pierre Kalfon (Morovich), Dana Elcar (Russ), Vernon Dobtcheff (Russian agent), Robert Arden (CIA chief). Suggested by The Game of X by Robert Sheckley. The movie was filmed at Pinewood Studios in England as well as on location in France, Monaco, Yugoslavia, Italy, and Switzerland. First- and second-unit crews filmed simultaneously in separate locations. While the principals filmed scenes with dialogue, the second-unit crew performed high-speed chases&mdash;in racing cars on stretches of road in southern France, and with boats in the Mediterranean off St. Tropez and Nice&mdash;rigged explosions and crashes, and performed aerial work on the tram cable at the Matterhorn and off the Eiffel tower. Automobiles and boats used in the movie were a speed enthusiast&rsquo;s dream: seven Porsche 935 Turbo Carreras comprised the deadly pursuit squadron of the Russian KGB; two Group 5 Lemans Porsches, competition racing cars, were used by the squadron leader, Morovitch, and the &ldquo;Condor Car&rdquo; was portrayed by four modified Sterling racers. Woody Wilkins&rsquo; comic book inventions, which include a machine gun/walking stick, a laser cannon, self-propelling jet rods to ride the cable up the Matterhorn, and his semi-aeronautic Condorman wings, were built by Academy Award-winning special effects artist Colin Chilvers.

    "long_description": "Watcher in the Woods, The (film) When an American composer and his family rent a foreboding house in England from an eccentric recluse, Mrs. Aylwood, a series of terrifying events occur, primarily to 17-year-old Jan. It turns out that the eerie experiences are connected to Mrs. Aylwood&rsquo;s teenage daughter&rsquo;s disappearance 30 years earlier. A reenactment of the disappearance unexpectedly reveals the secret of the unknown force. Released on October 7, 1981. An earlier version premiered April 16, 1980, in New York but was withdrawn so a new ending could be filmed. Directed by John Hough. 84 min. Stars Bette Davis (Mrs. Aylwood), Carroll Baker (Helen), David McCallum (Paul), Lynn-Holly Johnson (Jan Curtis), Kyle Richards (Ellie), Ian Bannen (John Keller), Richard Pasco (Tom Colley), Frances Cuka (Mary Fleming), Benedict Taylor (Mike Fleming), Eleanor Summerfield (Mrs. Thayer), Georgina Hale (young Mrs. Aylwood). The film was based on the novel A Watcher in the Woods by Florence Engel Randall. St. Hubert&rsquo;s Manor, a huge estate situated near Ivor Heath, Buckinghamshire, was used as the site of the Curtises&rsquo; vacation dwelling. Ettington Park Manor, a Gothic mansion, and an old stone chapel nearby were also used in the film. Scenes were also filmed at Pinewood Studios, London. Art Cruickshank and Bob Broughton supervised the supernatural effects, utilizing Disney&rsquo;s ACES (Automated Camera Effects System), which culminated in the finale. However, when early audiences in New York saw its premiere and disliked that special-effects-laden ending, the Studio cut it. Mary Poppins was re-released to fill the gap, while a new ending was filmed and the movie was released again in October 1981. But it was too late, and the film generally failed at the box office despite the wonderfully eerie direction, music, and Bette Davis&rsquo;s performance. Released on video in 1982.

Realizing that a balloon might be the answer, Peter and G&uuml;nter buy materials and begin building one in secret. The first flight, with just Peter&rsquo;s family&mdash;G&uuml;nter&rsquo;s wife had convinced him to abandon the project&mdash;crashes just short of the border. With the police closing in rapidly, the Strelzyks, once more joined by the Wetzels, make a final attempt to fly to freedom and this time achieve success. Released on February 5, 1982. Directed by Delbert Mann. 107 min. Stars John Hurt (Peter Strelzyk), Jane Alexander (Doris), Glynnis O&rsquo;Connor (Petra), Doug McKeon (Frank), Beau Bridges (G&uuml;nter Wetzel), Ian Bannen (Josef), Klaus L&ouml;witsch (Schmalk), Anne Stallybrass (Magda Keller), Kay Walsh (Doris&rsquo;s mother). Moved by newspaper accounts of the daring escape, Disney executive Ron Miller and producer Tom Leetch contacted European story editor Eva Redfern with instructions to pursue the film rights. Impressed by the Disney television shows that were beamed from West to East Germany, the two couples accepted Disney&rsquo;s offer. The families flew to California to provide background material with the added inducement of a grand tour of Disneyland. To assure authenticity, the producers decided to film the entire production in West Germany in Landsberg, Muhltal, Harthausen, and Munich. Near the town of Eulenschwang production designer Rolf Zehetbauer and art director Herbert Strabel spent $300,000 to re-create a half-mile section of the border that separated East and West Germany, authentic down to the wire mesh fencing, concrete posts, automated shrapnel guns, leashed guard dogs, and impregnable cast iron barricades. One of the large exhibition halls at the I.B.O. fairgrounds, in Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance, was turned into the world&rsquo;s largest &ldquo;green set&rdquo; for filming scenes under controlled conditions. Within the 5,000-square-yard area, 300 pine trees were transplanted for the forest, and to shut out the light from the glass-walled structure, 6,000 square yards of black plastic covered the walls. The final cost for the set was $150,000. At the Bavaria Film Studio, interior filming was done on four sound stages. Gary Cerveny of Balloon Ventures, Inc. of Glendale, California, made and flew a total of seven hot-air balloons for the production. The balloons were re-created as closely as possible to the original. The only changes were in the material used and certain technical improvements to comply with FAA standards. What made the real-life flight all the more miraculous was that the experts say their balloon shouldn&rsquo;t have flown at all. With all the proper equipment, sophisticated electronic devices and human expertise, Cerveny had extreme difficulty getting the exact reproductions airborne. Released on video in 1982.

Flynn awakens in an electronic world, where computer programs are the alter egos of the programmers who created them, and he is sentenced to die on the video game grid.&nbsp; Together with Tron, an electronic security program, Flynn escapes, destroys the MCP, and is able to return to the &ldquo;real&rdquo; world.&nbsp; Released on July 9, 1982.&nbsp; Directed by Steven Lisberger.&nbsp; 96 min.&nbsp; Photographed in Super Panavision 70mm, this special effects tour de force stars Jeff Bridges (Kevin Flynn/Clu), Bruce Boxleitner (Alan/Tron), David Warner (Dillinger/Sark), Cindy Morgan (Lora/Yori), Barnard Hughes (Dr. Walter/Gibbs), Dan Shor (Ram), Peter Jurasik (Crom), Tony Stephano (Peter/Sark&rsquo;s Lt.).&nbsp; The idea for Tron grew out of director Lisberger&rsquo;s passion for computer games.&nbsp; He and producer Donald Kushner spent two years researching the technology to make the film, on which he made his live-action directorial debut.&nbsp; The film was the first motion picture to make extensive use of computer imagery, requiring much expertise and imagination.&nbsp; Though computer imagery had been previously seen as an effect in motion pictures such as Star Wars and West World , Tron was the first film to use the technique to create a three-dimensional world.&nbsp; The special effects team was headed by futuristic industrial designer Syd Mead, comic artist &ldquo;Moebius&rdquo; Giraud, and high-tech commercial artist Peter Lloyd.&nbsp; Harrison Ellenshaw supervised the effects with Richard Taylor.&nbsp; Computer graphics were first applied to aerospace and scientific research in the mid-1960s, when methods of simulating objects digitally in their dimensions proved as effective as building models.&nbsp; The technology was then diverted into the entertainment field.&nbsp; Information International Inc. (Triple-I), Robert Able &amp; Associates of Los Angeles, the Mathematic Applications Group Inc. (MAGI), and Digital Effects of New York produced the computer imagery for the film.&nbsp; MAGI, the single largest contributor of computer imagery, speeded up the process of supplying its work to Disney Studios in Burbank by a trans-continental computer hook-up.&nbsp; The computer link cut between 2 1/2 to 5 days from the creation of each scene.&nbsp; The electronic world was shot on soundstages at the Disney Studio in Burbank.&nbsp; Photography for the real world took place at locations around Los Angeles, and at the U.S. Government&rsquo;s futuristic Lawrence Livermore Laboratory outside Oakland, California.&nbsp; The film was not the box office bonanza the Studio had hoped for, but it did spawn a number of popular video games.&nbsp; Tron&nbsp; was nominated for an Academy Award for Sound, by Michael, Bob, and Lee Minkler and Jim La Rue, and for Costume Design by Elois Jenssen and Rosanna Norton.&nbsp; Released on video in 1982 and 1993.

Mason takes over running the household and, to make ends meet, sells Tex&rsquo;s beloved horse, Rowdy. Tex gets mad at Mason and heedlessly tumbles into scrape after scrape. When his Pop comes home, Tex is shocked to learn that he isn&rsquo;t his real father. But Tex realizes that Mason and Pop do love him, and it is time to start growing up. Released on July 30, 1982, briefly, then withdrawn and released again on September 24, 1982. Directed by Tim Hunter. 103 min. Stars Matt Dillon (Tex McCormick), Jim Metzler (Mason), Meg Tilly (Jamie), Bill McKinney (Pop), Frances Lee McCain (Mrs. Johnson), Ben Johnson (Cole), Emilio Estevez (Johnny Collins). Tex represented the film debuts of both Meg Tilly and Emilio Estevez. The film is based on the novel by S.E. Hinton. Tex was an experiment by the Disney Studio to reach a new generation of teenagers who often abandoned Disney films for more &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; live-action fare, and this accounts for the PG rating. The movie represents a faithful adaptation of the novel where teen problems are confronted directly and honestly with no easy solutions or false hopes necessarily offered. Aware that Disney was seeking to broaden the content horizon of their films, it was director and screenwriter Tim Hunter who originally recommended Tex to the studio, suggesting Matt Dillon (a fan of Miss Hinton&rsquo;s books, which included The Outsiders ) as the lead. Hunter viewed the association between Disney and Hinton as &ldquo;a lucky convergence that compromises neither the book nor the studio&rsquo;s high standards for family entertainment.&rdquo; But the experiment was not a box office success, despite the time, care and talent that went into the production.

Dark transforms some of the townspeople as the boys try to find out the secret of the carnival. The boys hide from Dark, who threatens Will&rsquo;s father, the town librarian, who in turn finally helps good triumph over evil as he saves the boys and causes the destruction of the ominous carnival. Released on April 29, 1983. Directed by Jack Clayton. 95 min. Stars Jason Robards (Charles Halloway), Jonathan Pryce (Mr. Dark), Diane Ladd (Mrs. Nightshade) Pam Grier (Dust Witch), Royal Dano (Tom Fury), Vidal Peterson (Will), Shawn Carson (Jim). The film began life as a short story in a publication called Weird Tales in May 1948, then called &ldquo;Black Ferris,&rdquo; written by famed science fiction author Ray Bradbury. It became his favorite work and when he saw Gene Kelly&rsquo;s direction of Invitation to a Dance , he personally delivered the story to the star&rsquo;s home in order to work for and with Kelly on a film version of his story. Kelly agreed, but failed to raise the necessary funding. Over the next several years Bradbury converted his screenplay into the novel that was published in 1962 as Something Wicked This Way Comes , and was an immediate, and enduring, best seller. Producers Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler and directors Sam Peckinpah, Mark Rydell, and Steven Spielberg are among those who were associated with the property over the years. Producer Peter Vincent Douglas&rsquo;s fascination with Bradbury&rsquo;s works culminated in a chance meeting with the celebrated author in 1976, in a bookstore, where Douglas discovered the rights to the novel were available again. Acquiring them, he met with director Clayton and over the next several years, they worked on a script. In 1980 Disney production vice president Tom Wilhite expressed an interest in the project, and in September 1981 the production went before the cameras. Green Town was created on the Disney Studio&rsquo;s backlot, after the long-standing generic town square set was bulldozed. It took nearly 200 construction workers to build the one-acre set featuring the elaborate, Victorian-style town. The carnival, a tent, and caravan-lined midway covering two acres was likewise constructed on the Disney lot. Some sequences were shot on location in Vermont to provide the proper atmosphere. Live tarantulas were provided for the movie by Animal Actors of Hollywood, and though they performed dutifully, Studio veterans claim that a few got loose on the lot, causing consternation wherever they turned up.

Scientists capture Madison, but she is saved by Allen and his philandering brother, Freddie. Allen and Madison finally elude their captors by leaping into the ocean. Released on March 9, 1984.

Shull (Dr. Ross), Bobby Di Cicco (Jerry), Howard Morris (Dr. Zidell), Tony Di Benedetto (Tim). The production took 17 days of principal photography on location in New York City, filming at such landmarks as the Statue of Liberty, the Museum of Natural History and its renowned whale room, Bloomingdale&rsquo;s department store, and Columbus Circle. When Rockefeller Center&rsquo;s ice skating rink closed prematurely for reconstruction, the production was granted permission to build a special rink and film in Central Park. The production then moved to Los Angeles for additional filming at locations throughout Southern California before traveling to the Bahamas for the underwater sequences. Producer Brian Grazer spent much of four years exploring various approaches to the undersea filming. He opted for the real thing, filming 50 feet down in the Caribbean waters surrounding the Bahamas. The actors received special training in diving and adapting to their confining locations. Each was required to swim from one safety diver to another, through a shot, for their supply of air. Noted underwater cinematographer Jordan Klein storyboarded each frame of film they would be shooting. The director and producer were so pleased with Daryl Hannah&rsquo;s swimming that they allowed her to do all her own stunts. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Screenplay.

    "long_description": "Country (film) A soft-spoken farmer&rsquo;s wife, Jewell Ivy, demonstrates surprising heroism when faced with the government&rsquo;s forced foreclosure of her family&rsquo;s farm. Her husband, Gil, is nearly destroyed by the tragic turn of events. Jewell manages to hold her family together while enlisting the aid of other farmers facing the same problems. Released on September 29, 1984 after a premiere on September 28 at the New York Film Festival. A Touchstone film. Directed by Richard Pearce. 110 min. Stars Jessica Lange (Jewell Ivy), Sam Shepherd (Gil Ivy), Wilford Brimley (Otis), Matt Clark (Tom McMullen), Therese Graham (Marlene Ivy), Levi L. Knebel (Carlisle Ivy), Jim Haynie (Arlon Brewer), Sandra Seacat (Louise Brewer), Alex Harvey (Fordyce). The film was co-produced by actress Lange. Along with screenwriter/co-producer William D. Wittliff, Lange fleshed out the basic plot of Country and met with farmers in the Midwest whose livelihoods had been threatened by forced foreclosures. The start of production saw cast and crew in a race against the elements to film an Iowa corn harvest. Sam Shepard took the controls of a massive gleaner-combine, which harvested the crop. Next the company moved onto the key set some 20 miles northeast of Waterloo in the farmlands of Iowa. There, a turn-of-the-century farmstead, slated to be demolished by its owner who wanted additional acreage for growing feed corn, became the Ivy farm. For three months the company worked 12-hour days capturing the reality of farm living. A secondary location was the rural hamlet of Readlyn, Iowa, with its giant grain elevators and broad main street. Winter arrived sooner than expected, and during the climactic auction sequence in which 100 local townspeople appeared, the wind chill factor steadied at 25 degrees below zero. Director Pearce could only film in five-minute segments before the Iowans had to break for the barn where red-hot butane heaters unsuccessfully attempted to warm the icy air. The harsh winter caused the production to move back to the Disney Burbank studio where interiors and the tornado sequences were filmed. The affecting piano solos were provided by George Winston. Jessica Lange was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Actress. Released on video in 1985 and 1989. Countdown to Extinction Country Address",

With her husband, she attempts to rescue them from an evil scientist who, with government support, is trying to capture the creatures. Soldiers kill the father and capture the mother, but the scientist manages to save the baby brontosaurus. After a series of hair-raising adventures the couple defeats the evil scientist and reunites the infant with its mother. Released on March 22, 1985. Directed by B.W.L. Norton. A Touchstone film. 93 min. Stars William Katt (George Loomis), Sean Young (Susan Matthews-Loomis), Patrick McGoohan (Dr. Eric Kivist), Kyalo Mativo (Cephu). Central to the plot are the dinosaur characters designed and constructed by mechanical effects experts Ron Tantin and Isidoro Raponi. These characters, among the largest and most complex ever created for the screen, required almost one full year of planning. The dinosaur models range in size from a full-scale father (70 feet long and 25 feet high) to a miniature baby (30 inches long and 10 inches high). The dinosaurs were sculpted and molded in the United States and reconstructed at two &ldquo;dino bases&rdquo; in the Ivory Coast. After a global search, the filmmakers settled on the Ivory Coast because of its tropical rain forest and primitive bush villages. The film crew, based in Abidjan (population 1.5 million), utilized locations in the nearby Parc National du Banco for tropical jungle scenes. Several villages within a 70-kilometer radius and situated along the Comoe River were also primary sites. Filming was completed at the Disney Studio in Burbank.

She awakens the next day in Oz. But her happiness in returning to Oz soon dissolves into horror as she finds the magical land in ruins, and the Emerald City a wasteland. The kingdom is now ruled by the Nome King and the wicked Princess Mombi, who captures Dorothy. But she escapes with the aid of new friends: Tik-Tok, Billina, a talking hen, Jack Pumpkinhead, and the Gump. They travel to the Nome King&rsquo;s mountain in the Deadly Desert to find the Scarecrow, and must play a nightmarish game with the evil monarch to save their friend. Dorothy manages to emerge victorious, save her friends, and rescue the mystical princess Ozma, thereby restoring Oz to its former glory. Released on June 21, 1985. Directed by Walter Murch. 109 min. Stars Nicol Williamson (Dr. Worley/Nome King), Fairuza Balk (Dorothy), Jean Marsh (Nurse Wilson/Princess Mombi), Piper Laurie (Aunt Em), Matt Clark (Uncle Henry), Emma Ridley (Ozma), Michael Sundin (Tik-Tok puppeteer), Peter Elliot (Wheeler), Pons Maar (Lead Wheeler), Justin Case (Scarecrow), John Alexander (Cowardly Lion), Deep Roy (Tin Man), and puppet performers Brian Henson and Mac Wilson. The production marked the culmination of three years of preparatory work and research in the United States and Britain. New systems of remote control, stop-motion photography, and a pioneering clay animation process created a wonderland that blended the realistic with the surreal. Sixteen weeks of shooting included interior work on five Elstree stages and filming on the studio lot. There was an additional location on Salisbury Plain, the site of Stonehenge. The production was the realization of Walt Disney&rsquo;s personal interest in the Oz stories by L. Frank Baum. On November 16, 1954, Disney purchased the rights to 11 of Baum&rsquo;s books from the author&rsquo;s son, Robert S. Baum. Originally the Oz stories were considered as the basis for a two-part television show in the Disneyland series and in April 1957 the studio hired Dorothy Cooper to write a preliminary outline of the story. Her original storyline was called Dorothy Returns To Oz . The title changed in August to The Rainbow Road to Oz , and it was largely based on The Patchwork Girl of Oz . Disney realized that his Oz film had become too ambitious a project for television. He announced in November of that same year that a multimillion-dollar live-action musical feature was to start. Bill Walsh was named as producer and Sid Miller as director. Miller wrote songs and musical numbers with Tom Adair and Buddy Baker. To arouse public interest in the project, Disney featured a short Rainbow Road To Oz segment on one of his television shows ( The Fourth Anniversary Show of Disneyland on September 11, 1957), which featured two production numbers on three sets, including 120 feet of Yellow Brick Road. Fearing another studio might rush out an Oz film, Disney bought a 12 th title from Lippert Pictures, paying almost as much for it as he had for the 11 he already owned. By February 1958, however, the project had died because of Disney&rsquo;s frustrations with the script and designs, and perhaps fear of competing with the 1939 MGM musical, which was gaining renewed popularity via television exposure at that time. Unfortunately, the Disney film was not a box office success, though it was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects to Will Vinton, Ian Wingrove, Zoran Perisic, and Michael Lloyd.

The King tries to get Hen Wen to lead him to the mysterious Black Cauldron. Taran escapes with a young princess and a minstrel, and with the help of mischievous Gurgi, finds the Cauldron. Before they can destroy it, it is taken by the Horned King, who begins to unleash its awesome power of producing deathless warriors. Gurgi sacrifices himself to destroy the Cauldron&rsquo;s power and save his friends, but in the end, Taran defeats the Horned King and Gurgi is restored. Released on July 24, 1985. Directed by Ted Berman and Richard Rich. Filmed in 70mm stereo-surround Technirama. Features the voices of John Hurt (Horned King), Grant Bardsley (Taran), John Byner (Gurgi), Susan Sheridan (Eilonwy), Freddie Jones (Dallben), Nigel Hawthorne (Fflewddur Fflam), Phil Fondacaro (Creeper). 80 min. The production can be traced back to 1971, when the Disney Studio purchased the screen rights to Lloyd Alexander&rsquo;s The Chronicles of Prydain . The five-volume mythological fantasy had been published in the mid-1960s to critical acclaim and commercial success. Adapting Alexander&rsquo;s books with their numerous story lines and cast of over 30 major characters proved to be a time-consuming task. Several important writer/animators worked on the development of a screenplay through the 1970s until Joe Hale was named producer in 1980. He rewrote the script, capsulizing the sprawling story and making some changes. For instance, the Horned King was a minor character in the series but since he had so many possibilities, Hale expanded his role, making the villain a composite of several characters from the books. Filmmakers took advantage of the latest technology, which became essential in the completion of the film. Video cameras gave animators and directors an immediate and inexpensive record of what their efforts might look like. Computers also made inroads in the manipulation of solid inanimate objects on screen. The dimensions and volume of objects were fed into a computer and then their shapes were perfectly maintained as their movement was generated by programming. Disney&rsquo;s venerable multiplane cameras were updated with computers to expedite and control aperture settings and time exposures. Another technological breakthrough was the development of the APT (Animation Photo Transfer) process. The first major change in the Studio&rsquo;s method of transferring the artist&rsquo;s drawings to a cel since photocopying replaced hand inking 20 years earlier, the APT greatly improved the quality of the animator&rsquo;s art. In all, the animated film was 12 years in the making&mdash;five years in actual production&mdash;at the cost of over $25 million. Over 1,165 different hues and colors were implemented and over 34 miles of film stock was utilized. This was the first animated Disney film made in cooperation with Silver Screen Partners II. The sheer lavishness of the production, however, did not guarantee huge grosses, and the film was a box office failure. David W. Spencer was awarded an Academy Award for his development of the APT process. Released on video in 1998. Black Arrow (television) Black Hole, The (film)",

She sets off alone to follow him across the country. She hops trains, befriends a wolf and a teenage drifter, and after a series of adventures is reunited with her father. Released on September 27, 1985. Directed by Jeremy Kagan. 101 min. Stars Meredith Salenger (Natty Gann), John Cusack (Harry), Ray Wise (Sol Gann), Barry Miller (Parker), Scatman Crothers (Sherman), Lainie Kazan (Connie), Verna Bloom (Farm woman), Bruce M. Fischer (Charlie Linfield). Production designer Paul Sylbert was called upon to create a vintage Chicago street scene complete with pushcart vendors, a Hooverville consisting of 60 shacks, and an authentic period logging camp. The film’s emphasis on authenticity extended to the activities of the lumber camp. Ray Wise, playing Natty’s father, learned how to top trees with a big ax as it was actually done 50 years ago. For some scenes he had to climb 40-foot-high trees. The local experts recognized his talents and at the completion of shooting awarded him a handmade throwing ax and target. Salenger performed most of her own stunts. The “wolf” Natty encounters in the film was a wolf/malamute mix named Jed, who, with the application of some water-based makeup, looked the part. Costume designer Albert Wolsky also relied heavily on photographic research in creating the wardrobe. In all, Wolsky came up with nearly 2,000 costumes for the film, including some scenes with more than 250 extras. Hats were frequently used to disguise the 1980s-style coiffures. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Costume Design. Released on video in 1986.",

Gideon, a Christmas angel, appears to help and causes a number of seeming tragedies in the family’s life. He then takes the daughter on a visit to Santa Claus to retrieve a letter the mother had written years before. The letter helps the mother regain her Christmas spirit, and Gideon turns back the clock to negate the tragic events. Released on November 22, 1985. Directed by Phillip Borsos. 89 min. Stars Mary Steenburgen (Ginny Grainger), Harry Dean Stanton (Gideon), Arthur Hill (Caleb Grainger), Elizabeth Harnois (Abbie), Gary Basaraba (Jack), Robbie Magwood (Cal). Walt Disney Pictures agreed to co-finance this film with the participation of Silver Screen Partners II and Telefilm Canada. Filming took place in Toronto. The Christmas spirit prevailed during the early stages of principal photography at a Toronto shopping center when more than 300 extras turned out for a Sunday shoot. At the location, 50 shopkeepers took down their current Valentine’s Day decorations and replaced them with Christmas decor. The shopping center also offered a Santa Claus Village complete with Santa, a 20-piece brass band and an all-girl choir singing Christmas carols. In the Toronto suburb of Scarborough, all the residents in a three-block radius also joined in the true spirit of Christmas and happily bedecked their houses with seasonal decorations for the six days of filming in their area. Throughout the filming, as the production moved to the towns of Owen Sound and Meaford, the inconsistent weather nearly made filming impossible, as the crew faced rain, fog, sleet, blizzard, winds gusting up to 50 mph, mud, 15-foot snow drifts denying access to country locations and, often, zero visibility. Production designer Bill Brodie constructed three major sets: the Grainger house, the grandfather’s home, and Santa’s workshop and cottage, which was filled with real rare toys, insured for $1 million prior to filming, and 20,000 actual letters to Santa from the Toronto main post office.

Muhich (Dr. Von Zimmer). For the role of the lovable Matisse, the Whiteman family’s emotionally disturbed dog, a pair of look-alike Scottish Border Collies were used: Davey, did all the action, while Mike did the interrelational scenes. In the brief role as Sadie Whiteman, mother to Richard Dreyfuss’ character, Dreyfuss’ own mother, Geraldine Dreyfuss, was used. The majority of the film was shot on studio soundstages. The back of the Whiteman house as well as the swimming pool and a fully landscaped yard were constructed on the Disney backlot. Daytime shots involving the front of the house were shot at an actual location in Beverly Hills, and because of various permit restrictions, night work in front of the house had to be shot at the Columbia Ranch where a duplicate facade of the Beverly Hills house was built. There was location work at the Rodeo Collection on Rodeo Drive, the Union Rescue Mission in downtown Los Angeles, the Los Angeles International Airport, Venice Beach, the old Cyrano’s restaurant on the Sunset Strip and numerous locations in and around Beverly Hills.

The score was written by composer Henry Mancini, who also collaborated on two of the three featured songs with lyricists Larry Grossman and Ellen Fitzhugh; the third song, “Let Me Be Good to You, ” was written and performed by Melissa Manchester. Based on Eve Titus’s book, Basil of Baker Street. After a four-year period of story development, animation took just over one year to complete. This remarkably short production span was possible due to new efficiencies in the production process (such as video tests and computer-assisted layouts and graphics), and an increased emphasis on story development prior to the start of production. A total of 125 artists were involved in making the film. An innovative application of computer technology can be seen in the climactic scene where Basil faces Ratigan in a final confrontation inside the turning and thrashing gearworks of Big Ben. The 54 moving gears, winches, ratchets, beams, and pulleys were literally drawn by the computer, and created a unique background for the characters that had been animated in the usual way. The film was re-released in theaters in 1992 under the title The Adventures of the Great Mouse Detective. Released on video in 1992 and 1999.",

    "long_description": "Who Framed Roger Rabbit (film) Roger Rabbit is a toon, an animated star at Maroon Cartoon Studio. After an opening cartoon, Somethin’s Cookin’, we discover that Roger is suspected of the murder of Marvin Acme, who owned Toontown and the company that makes all cartoon props, and who had been flirting with Roger’s wife, Jessica. Down-on-his-luck private detective Eddie Valiant is asked by Roger to find the real culprit. He reluctantly agrees and soon discovers that there is more to the mysterious Judge Doom than meets the eye. Chased by Doom’s weasel henchmen, Eddie visits Toontown, with its many well-known toon inhabitants, before discovering the identity of the murderer. Premiered at Radio City Music Hall on June 21, 1988; general release on June 22, 1988. Directed by Robert Zemeckis. A Touchstone film in association with Steven Spielberg. 103 min. Stars Bob Hoskins (Eddie Valiant), Christopher Lloyd (Judge Doom), Joanna Cassidy (Dolores), Stubby Kaye (Marvin Acme). Charles Fleischer provided the voice of Roger Rabbit. Based on the novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit?, by Gary K. Wolf. Original work on the film began many years before it was produced. The expected high costs for the necessary special effects made Disney executives move cautiously, and it was only when Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis became interested in the project that the green light was given. They were excited by the prospect of creating a Toon community, with a variety of cartoon characters, culled from different studios, and presented together on screen for the first time. It was Spielberg who was able to help along the complicated negotiations necessary to bring the classic animated personalities together. Zemeckis welcomed the chance to create a new cartoon character, Roger Rabbit. He joked that the character was a combination of “a Disney body, a Warner’s head, and a Tex Avery attitude.” It was filmed in Los Angeles, and at Elstree Studios in London. Richard Williams headed the large staff of animators at a new studio set up in London, with some additional animation done in Burbank. The special visual effects were created by Industrial Light & Magic. The film won four Academy Awards, the most for a Disney film since Mary Poppins. They were for Film Editing (Arthur Schmidt), Sound Effects Editing (Charles L. Campbell, Louis L. Edemann), Visual Effects (Ken Ralston, Richard Williams, Edward Jones, George Gibbs), and an award for Special Achievement in Animation Direction to Richard Williams. Released on video in 1989.",

    "long_description": "Oliver & Company (film) The Oliver Twist story animated with a twist—the setting is New York and Oliver is a kitten and Fagin the human master of a pack of pickpocket dogs. When a wealthy little girl from Fifth Avenue finds Oliver and takes him uptown to live in her mansion, Fagin’s evil boss, Sykes, steps in and kidnaps the pair. His nasty plan is foiled however, when Oliver’s motley crew of dog buddies, aided by Jenny’s prissy poodle, Georgette, decide to use their street savoir faire in order to rescue their feline friend. Released on November 18, 1988. Directed by George Scribner. 72 min. With the voices of Joey Lawrence (Oliver), Billy Joel (Dodger), Cheech Marin (Tito), Richard Mulligan (Einstein), Roscoe Lee Browne (Francis), Sheryl Lee Ralph (Rita), Dom De Luise (Fagin), Robert Loggia (Sykes), Bette Midler (Georgette). Twelve-year-old Joey Lawrence would later go on to become a teenage heartthrob on Blossom. Six supervising animators and a team of over 300 artists and technicians worked for over two and a half years to create this hand-drawn feature film in the time-honored Disney tradition. More than a million story sketches and drawings were required to produce the 119, 275 hand-painted cels that comprise the finished film. Designers went to New York and photographed street scenes from a dog’s perspective—18 inches off the ground—getting stares from passersby but providing excellent reference material for the layout artists. To give the backgrounds a contemporary and hard-edged look, Xerox overlays were used, the first time for this approach since One Hundred and One Dalmatians. Many of the inanimate objects in the film were created and animated on the computer—cars, cabs, buses, Sykes’s limousine, Fagin’s trike (part scooter and part shopping cart), a cement mixer, a sewer pipe, a spiral staircase, a piano, subway tunnels and trains, cityscapes, and even the Brooklyn Bridge. This was the first film to have its own department set up expressly for the purpose of generating computer animation. Many different songwriters contributed to the production, including Howard Ashman and Barry Mann (“Once Upon a Time in New York City”), Dan Hartman and Charlie Midnight (“Why Should I Worry?”), Barry Manilow, Jack Feldman, and Bruce Sussman (“Perfect Isn’t Easy”), and Dean Pitchford and Tom Snow (“Streets of Gold”).

    "long_description": "New York Stories (film) Combination of three short stories—Life Lessons, Life Without Zoe, and Oedipus Wrecks—each about life with intriguing characters in New York City. In Life Lessons, contemporary New York artist Lionel Dobie is suffering from “painter’s block” when his lover-assistant Paulette announces that she is leaving him. He convinces her to stay, and while her coolness to him infuriates him, at the same time it inspires him. The more their relationship deteriorates, the more compelled and creative he becomes, while Paulette doubts her own talents as an artist. Ultimately Paulette leaves, and the successful artist finds a new student to whom he can give “life lessons.” In Life Without Zoe, 12-year-old Zoe lives on her own at the Sherry Netherland Hotel with her butler, Hector, while her famous parents follow their own separate careers all over the world. Zoe becomes friends with a lonely rich boy, upon hearing him play the flute. She gets involved in a plot between a princess and her jealous husband that might cause Zoe’s father harm. Her worldly wisdom and affection for her parents saves the day, and brings mother and father back together again. In Oedipus Wrecks, Sheldon is embarrassed by his mother, who doesn’t seem to approve of anything about him—especially his shiksa fiancée, Lisa. Sheldon’s wish that his mother just “disappear” comes true during a magic show. He is first distraught but then increasingly content with life without Mother. Suddenly, Mother reappears—personality intact, but in a rather different “form”—creating havoc for Sheldon and all the people of New York City. On the advice of his psychiatrist, Sheldon turns to psychic Treva, who tries to return Mother to her original state. The strain is too much for Lisa, and she leaves Sheldon. Treva fears she is a failure at everything, since she hasn’t been able to bring Mother back, but Sheldon finds consolation in her, making everyone happy: Sheldon, Treva, and Mother.

    "long_description": "Rescuers Down Under, The (film) In Australia, the young Cody discovers that evil Percival McLeach has captured the magnificent eagle, Marahute. He manages to set her free only to be kidnapped himself, and later to see her recaptured. A frantic call for help goes out to the Rescue Aid Society, which sends the intrepid Bernard and Miss Bianca to help. They are aided by Wilbur from Albatross Air Lines, and in Australia are joined by Jake and frill-necked lizard Frank, in trying to outwit McLeach and save Marahute. Released on November 16, 1990. Directed by Hendel Butoy and Mike Gabriel. 74 min. Features the voice talents of Bob Newhart (Bernard), Eva Gabor (Bianca), John Candy (Wilbur), Tristan Rogers (Jake), Adam Ryen (Cody), Wayne Robson (Frank), George C. Scott (Percival McLeach), Douglas Seale (Krebbs), Frank Welker (Joanna). The first Disney animated classic essentially to be a sequel, to the 1977 hit film, The Rescuers . The production required a team of more than 415 artists and technicians. Five key members of the creative team traveled to the Australian Outback to observe for themselves its unique beauty, which they wanted to capture on film. They came home with hundreds of photographs of Ayers Rock, Katherine Gorge, and Kakadu National Park, and countless filled sketchbooks. Since Jim Jordan, who had voiced the albatross Orville in the original The Rescuers , had passed away, it was Roy E. Disney who suggested the character of Wilbur, Orville&rsquo;s brother, as a replacement. The names, of course, were a play on the Wright Brothers. While the animation itself would be done by hand as it always has been, for the first time computer technology took the place of the Xerox process and the hand painting of cels (and it also enabled the inclusion of several spectacular visuals). The marketing effort for the film did not call attention to the fact that cels were not used, so that the film would be reviewed on its own merits and not in comparison to earlier Disney films.

A frightened and guilt-stricken Simba flees into exile where he is befriended by a wacky but warmhearted warthog, Pumbaa, and his free-wheeling meerkat companion, Timon. Simba adopts their &ldquo;hakuna matata&rdquo; (no worries) attitude toward life, living on a diet of bugs and taking things one day at a time as he matures into a young adult. When his childhood friend, Nala, arrives on the scene, he is persuaded to return to the Pride Lands, which have fallen into hard times under Scar&rsquo;s reign, and take his rightful place as king. The wise shaman baboon, Rafiki, convinces Simba that his father&rsquo;s spirit lives on in him and that he must accept his responsibility, and when he returns, he manages to defeat Scar and an army of hyenas.

Songs were by Elton John and Tim Rice, with a background score by Hans Zimmer. Computer generated imagery was used to create the dramatic wildebeest stampede, a visual highlight in the film and a new level of sophistication for the art form. The original release was interrupted when kids went back to school in September, to return on November 18, 1994, this time paired with a 3-minute preview of Pocahontas . Released on video in 1995. The Lion King became one of the highest grossing films of all time. The song, &ldquo;Can You Feel the Love Tonight, &rdquo; won a Best Song Oscar for Elton John and Tim Rice, and a second Oscar was awarded to Hans Zimmer for Best Original Score. A stage show, based on the film, opened at the New Amsterdam Theater in New York City in 1997. The film was re-released in Imax and large format theaters on December 25, 2002. For the Special Edition Platinum DVD release in 2003, a song written for the stage play, &ldquo;The Morning Report, &rdquo; by Elton John and Tim Rice, was adapted, animated, and inserted into the body of the original film.

    "long_description": "Ed Wood (film) Edward D. Wood, Jr., an eccentric actor/writer/director, has only one thing going for him—an optimistic spirit that remains indomitable despite his obviously misguided career choices. Wood tries to make it in Hollywood, but earns the reputation of the “worst director of all time.” He has a fetish for wearing women’s clothes, and he gathers around him a bizarre band of characters, including the down-and-out screen legend Bela Lugosi, television horror queen Vampira, hulking Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson, psychic Criswell, and highbrow transvestite Bunny Breckinridge. Wood creates ineptly made, off-beat, low-budget independent films that somehow turn out to be cultish classics and turn their director into a legend. Limited release in Los Angeles and New York on September 28, 1994; general release on October 7, 1994. Directed by Tim Burton. A Touchstone film. Stars Johnny Depp (Ed Wood), Martin Landau (Bela Lugosi), Sarah Jessica Parker (Dolores Fuller), Patricia Arquette (Kathy O’Hara), Jeffrey Jones (Criswell), Bill Murray (Bunny Breckenridge). Based on a true story. Filmed in Los Angeles and its environs in black and white. 127 min.

But the wayfarers violate the Indians’ trust by abducting two braves—Squanto and Epenow—whom they intend to take back to England to display as exotic examples of primitive life. Driven by a passion for freedom, Squanto makes a dramatic escape and, against nearly impossible odds, survives a long and perilous journey back to his homeland. Upon his return, however, he discovers that everything has changed during his absence—his noble tribe has been wiped out by disease and the Mayflower pilgrims have settled into what little remains of Squanto’s village. Squanto must summon all he has learned over the course of his travels about goodwill and understanding if he is to survive. And the colonists, unprepared for the struggle they face, must learn to trust Squanto, the only man who can help them survive and broker a peace that will enable them to coexist with the Indians.

    "long_description": "Pocahontas (film) The first Disney animated feature based on historical fact, Pocahontas tells the story of the meeting of the English settlers in Jamestown with the local tribe of Powhatan Indians. The adventurous young Native American woman, Pocahontas, along with her constant companions, Meeko, a raccoon, and Flit, a hummingbird, visit Grandmother Willow, a counseling tree spirit, because she is uncertain about the path her life should take. She soon meets the brave English captain John Smith, and while opening his eyes to an understanding and respect for the world around him, the two fall in love. The other English settlers, led by Governor Ratcliffe, are intent on finding gold in the New World and become convinced the Native Americans are hiding the precious substance from them. Thomas, an inexperienced settler, kills the Native American brave, Kocoum, but Smith lets the Native Americans think he is responsible, so he is condemned to death. In begging her father, Chief Powhatan, to spare Smith’s life, Pocahontas finds that her path in life is to be instrumental in establishing the early peace between the Jamestown settlers and her tribe. Smith, however, is severely wounded by an enraged Ratcliffe and must return to England. Pocahontas and he part, each knowing their lives are richer for the love they share. Directed by Mike Gabriel and Eric Goldberg. Limited release on June 16; general release on June 23, 1995. Voices include Irene Bedard (Pocahontas speaking), Judy Kuhn (Pocahontas singing), Mel Gibson (Capt. John Smith), David Ogden Stiers (Ratcliffe/Wiggins), Linda Hunt (Grandmother Willow), Christian Bale (Thomas), Russell Means (Chief Powhatan). 81 min. Music is by Alan Menken with lyrics by Stephen Schwartz. Songs include “Just Around the Riverbend,” “Steady as the Beating Drum,” and “Colors of the Wind.” The look and style of the film were inspired by the filmmakers’ numerous visits to Jamestown, Virginia, as well as by extensive research into the Colonial period. The use of strong vertical and horizontal imagery in the design springs from the tall, vertical shapes of the Virginia pine forests and the vast horizontal landscapes. At various stages of the production, the creative team consulted with Native American scholars and storytellers to incorporate authentic aspects of the Powhatan culture into the film. The film had an outdoor premiere in New York’s Central Park on June 10, 1995. Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz were presented Oscars for Best Song (“Colors of the Wind”) and Menken won for Best Score. Released on video in 1996.",

Calvin discovers that he has been summoned to the 12th century by Merlin to help restore Arthur’s fading glory, and to prevent the realm from falling into the clutches of the sinister Lord Belasco. Calvin must find the courage to face Belasco and prove to himself that he has what it takes to be a worthy knight. Directed by Michael Gottlieb. A Walt Disney Picture in association with Tapestry Films and Trimark Pictures. Released on August 11, 1995. 90 min. Stars Thomas Ian Nicholas (Calvin Fuller), Joss Ackland (King Arthur), Ron Moody (Merlin), Art Malik (Lord Belasco). Kate Winslet, before becoming famous for her role in Titanic, played the role of Princess Sarah. To gain an authentic look, the producers decided to film in and around Budapest, Hungary. There they found a medieval castle and village set being used by a BBC television series that was on hiatus for the season. With a little redressing and redesigning, the set was just right. The production was truly international, for a final scene was filmed in England, the music was scored in Prague, and the final sound mix was done in Australia. An interesting bit of trivia—Ron Moody, who plays Merlin, played the same role for Disney 16 years earlier in Unidentified Flying Oddball. Released on video in 1996. A sequel, A Kid in Aladdin’s Palace (1997), with Thomas Ian Nicholas reprising his role as Calvin Fuller, was made as a direct-to-video film by Trimark, and had its world television premiere on Disney Channel in March 1999.",

Stars Miriam Margolyes (Sponge, Glowworm), Joanna Lumley (Spiker), Paul Terry (James), Pete Postlethwaite (old man), and the voices of Richard Dreyfuss (Centipede), Susan Sarandon (Miss Spider), Jane Leeves (Lady Bug), David Thewlis (Earthworm), Simon Callow (Grasshopper). 79 min. Based on the 1961 book by Roald Dahl. Five songs were written by Randy Newman: “My Name Is James,” “That’s the Life, ” “Eating the Peach,” “We’re Family, ” and “Good News.” Newman himself is the vocalist on the last song. The fantasy scenes were filmed using stop-motion animation enhanced by computer-generated imagery and digital effects. Live-action photography took place in a large hangar at a decommissioned naval base on Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay and at nearby Hunter’s Point. The animation was done at Skellington Productions in San Francisco, the same studio where The Nightmare Before Christmas had been produced, and it utilized some of the same crew. In the underwater sequence, one can even find a cameo appearance by Jack Skellington from the earlier film. More than 50 peaches were constructed for the film, ranging in size from three-inch miniatures up to 20-foot diameter jumbos. Two granddaughters of Roald Dahl, children of his daughter, Lucy, appear briefly as extras in the film. Lucy wrote the movie scrapbook, published by Disney Press and illustrated with her own photographs. Released on video in 1996.",

Attracting attention like no other woman before or since, she hypnotized a nation of 18 million people for seven years before her untimely death at the age of 33 in 1952. Directed by Alan Parker. A Cinergi production released by Hollywood Pictures. Released on December 25, 1996, in New York and Los Angeles; wider release on January 1 and general release on January 10, 1997. (The film had an earlier opening on December 20 in London.) Stars Madonna (Eva Perón), Antonio Banderas (Ché), Jonathan Pryce (Juan Perón). 135 min. Filmed in CinemaScope, in Argentina, Budapest (which more accurately replicated Buenos Aires of the 1930s and 1940s), and the U.K. It took much backstage persuasion, including entreaties by Madonna herself to the president of Argentina, to obtain last minute permission to shoot on the balcony of the Casa Rosada, the official government house. Madonna was fitted for over 80 costumes for the production. The film was based on a stage musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, which originated in a concept album released in 1976 while still unproduced on the stage; it opened on the stage in London in 1978 to great acclaim. The song, “You Must Love Me,” written specifically for the film by Webber and Rice, won the Academy Award for Best Song for 1996. Released on video in 1997.",

    "long_description": "Hercules (film) Hercules, the mighty son of Zeus and Hera, is taken from his Mount Olympus home and raised on Earth. The fiery figure behind Hercules’s disappearance is Hades, the hot-headed god of the Underworld who has grown tired of looking after a “bunch of deadbeats” and sees Zeus’s son as an obstacle to his plans to take over Olympus. Hades sends his two dim-witted sidekicks, Pain and Panic, to abduct Hercules, though they bungle their mission by not administering the final drop of a potent potion, which leaves the infant with god-like strength but human mortality. As Hercules grows up, he discovers the truth about his origins and sets out to prove himself a true hero (with the help of a veteran hero-training satyr named Philoctetes) so he can return to Olympus. Hades has other plans and tries to kill him by arranging a catalogue of calamities (a multiheaded Hydra, a Minotaur, a Cyclops, an army of Titans, and the traitorous damsel-in-distress, Megara). Along the way, Hercules discovers that a true hero is not measured by the size of his strength but the strength of his heart. Directed by John Musker and Ron Clements. General release on June 27, 1997, after a June 14 premiere at the New Amsterdam Theater in New York City, and a limited release beginning there the next day. Stars the voices of Danny DeVito (Phil), Tate Donovan (adult Hercules), Susan Egan (Megara), James Woods (Hades), Charlton Heston (opening narrator), Matt Frewer (Panic), Bobcat Goldthwait (Pain), Paul Shaffer (Hermes), Rip Torn (Zeus), Samantha Eggar (Hera), Joshua Keaton (teen Hercules speaking), Roger Bart (teen Hercules singing), Hal Holbrook (Amphitryon), Barbara Barrie (Alcmene). 93 min. Music, with six songs in a pastiche of styles, including gospel, is by Alan Menken with lyrics by David Zippel. Musker and Clements were attracted by the mythological aspects of the Hercules story, and decided to produce the film, along with Alice Dewey, in the fall of 1993. Over the next nine months, the two collaborated on an outline, several treatments, and eventually an initial script, aided by art director Andy Gaskill, who oversaw the visual development on the film. British artist/political cartoonist Gerald Scarfe, with a bold, expressive linear style, was brought in to assist with character design, and he remained involved as an ongoing artistic adviser to the animators. A field trip to Greece and Turkey in the summer of 1994 gave artists a firsthand look at landscapes and ancient sites, and an opportunity to hear expert accounts of classic Greek mythology. Animation began in early 1995, and eventually a team of nearly 700 artists were involved with the project. The film features the first use in animation of the process of morphing, wherein an object is made to smoothly transform into another, utilizing computer technology. Released on video in 1998.",

    "long_description": "George of the Jungle (film) Based on the well-known animated 1960s television series, this live-action film features the klutzy George, who grows up as a Tarzan-like character after surviving a jungle plane crash and being raised by gorillas. He rescues a beautiful wayward traveler named Ursula when a lion attacks her while she is on safari. While Ursula warms to George and his fantasy jungle world—complete with a talking ape, named Ape, and an elephant who thinks it is a dog—Ursula’s irksome fiancé, Lyle, plots to regain his lady love and destroy the balance of nature in George’s rain forest kingdom. When George is injured, Ursula brings him back to her world, specifically San Francisco, where he naturally has a difficult time adjusting and longs to return to his jungle home. Directed by Sam Weisman. Released on July 16, 1997. Stars Brendan Fraser (George), Leslie Mann (Ursula Stanhope), Thomas Haden Church (Lyle Van de Groot). 92 min. The elephant, Shep, is played by Tai, the 28-year-old veteran of such films as Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book and Operation Dumbo Drop, with his doglike movements added by Dream Quest Images through computer-generated enhancements. Ape and the other gorillas were the result of teaming live actors with a sophisticated radio telemetry system devised by the Jim Henson Creature Shop. Inspired by the wit, style, and humor of Jay Ward, who produced the animated series for four years, the film’s producers even retained the series’ catchy and now classic theme song. While San Francisco and Hawaii provided outdoor locations, parts of the jungle were also built indoors, utilizing the former Hughes Aircraft hangar in Playa del Rey, California, the same place where Howard Hughes built his Spruce Goose. Released on video in 1997.",

Selected for her courage, skills, and level headedness, O’Neil is determined to succeed in the most demanding, most merciless, and most honored fighting force in the world, in which 60 percent of her male counterparts will fail. Under the relentless command of Master Chief John Urgayle, O’Neil is put through weeks of physical and emotional hell, and is not expected to succeed. Indeed, military and high ranking government officials—including her sponsor, Senator Lillian DeHaven—are counting on her to fail. However, to their dismay and perplexity, O’Neil perseveres.

Production base was at the Atlas Studios outside of Ouarzazate.

When Mulan’s aged father is called to certain death in war, her bold compassion compels her to save his life by disguising herself as a man and joining the Chinese army in his place.

At the height of their success, their masquerade is revealed and both are abandoned in disgrace.

NASA’s executive director, Dan Truman, has only one option–to send up a crew to destroy the asteroid. He enlists the help of an unlikely hero, Harry S. Stamper–the world’s foremost deep-core oil driller–and Stamper’s roughneck team of drillers to land on the asteroid, drill 800 feet into its surface, and drop a nuclear device into the core. On this heroic journey, utilizing two space shuttles, Freedom and Independence, they face the most physically and emotionally challenging conditions ever encountered in order to save the world and prevent Armageddon. Directed by Michael Bay. A Touchstone Picture. Released on July 1, 1998, after a June 29 World Premiere screening at the Kennedy Space Center. Stars Bruce Willis (Harry Stamper), Billy Bob Thornton (Dan Truman), Liv Tyler (Grace Stamper), Ben Affleck (A.J. Frost), Will Patton (Chick Chapple), Peter Stormare (Lev Andropov), Keith David (General Kimsey), Owen Wilson (Oscar Choi), William Fichtner (Willie Sharp), Steve Buscemi (Rockhound). Filmed in CinemaScope. 151 min. NASA technical advisors who helped give some scientific accuracy to the project included their former Director of Advanced Programs, Ivan Bekey, and former astronaut, Joseph Allen. In order to experience some of the astronaut training firsthand, Willis and Affleck, along with members of the crew, spent several days at the Johnson Space Center in Texas, where the two actors were the first civilians to be allowed in the lab’s neutral-bouyancy tank, where astronauts train to work in space suits. In order to construct the asteroid set on Stage 2 at the Disney Studios, one of the largest in Hollywood, craftsmen had to excavate up to 30 feet below the stage level, so there would be space for the tall set pieces. Exterior shots utilized vast terrain outside of Kadoka, South Dakota. NASA allowed the company to shoot actual shuttle launches at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and to film at the Johnson Space Center and Ellington Air Field in Texas (where they received a surprise visit from former President George H. Bush). Armageddon became Disney’s highest grossing film, until passed by The Sixth Sense. Released on video in 1998.",

Fearsome and dangerous when provoked, he is tame in the hands of Jill, the 21-year-old orphan who raised the gorilla and named him Joe. When Joe’s life is threatened by poachers, Gregg and Jill rescue him by moving him to a California animal preserve. However, Joe is not safe for long. His newfound notoriety makes him a target for an enemy from his past, a ruthless poacher who is eager to steal Joe for his unique value in the endangered species black market. Feeling threatened and confused in his man-made confines, Joe finally escapes from captivity. With only Los Angeles and its terrified residents in his way, this powerful force of nature attempts to traverse a modern metropolis, leaving a trail of destruction and chaos in his wake. Jill and Gregg race to save Joe’s life before he is destroyed by the encircling authorities, and the chase culminates in an incredible and selfless display of courage by the mighty Joe, proving that within his fearsome frame beats a noble and heroic heart.

In scenes where the suits were used, the sets and props also had to be created at 40 percent size. Released on video in 1999.",

Wigand, former head of research and development and a corporate officer at Brown & Williamson, was a top scientist, the ultimate insider. No one like him had ever gone public before. Meanwhile, Lowell Bergman, investigative reporter and 60 Minutes producer, arranged a legal defense team for Wigand and taped a famous Mike Wallace interview that contained devastating testimony. However, before the most newsworthy 60 Minutes segment in years could air, Bergman would lose to a CBS corporate decision to kill it and experience breakdown and bitter divisions within 60 Minutes. Wigand would find himself sued, targeted in a national smear campaign, divorced, and facing possible incarceration. Wigand, having wagered so much and now unable to deliver his testimony to the American people, and Bergman, trying to defeat the smear campaign and force CBS to air the interview, are two ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. Released on November 5, 1999. A Touchstone Picture. Directed by Michael Mann. Stars Al Pacino (Lowell Bergman), Russell Crowe (Jeffrey Wigand), Christopher Plummer (Mike Wallace), Diane Venora (Liane Vigand), Philip Baker Hall (Don Hewitt), Lindsay Crouse (Sharon Tiller), Debi Mazar (Debbie De Luca).

In 1890, a wealthy sheik invited an American and his horse to enter the race for the first time. Frank T. Hopkins was a cowboy and dispatch rider for the U.S. Cavalry who had once been billed as the greatest rider the West had ever known. The sheik would put this claim to the test, pitting the American cowboy and his mustang, Hidalgo, against the world’s greatest Arabian horses and Bedouin riders, some of whom were determined to prevent the foreigner from finishing the race. For Frank, the Ocean of Fire becomes not only a matter of pride and honor, but a race for his very survival. Released on March 5, 2004. A Touchstone picture. Directed by Joe Johnston.

Returning to contribute music were original The Lion King songwriters Elton John and Tim Rice, composers Hans Zimmer and Lebo M, arranger Mark Mancina, orchestrator Bruce Fowler, and conductor Nick Glennie-Smith. Pharrell Williams produced five additional songs on the soundtrack. All of the songs have been retained from the 1994 animated feature, with three more added: “Spirit, “written by Timothy McKenzie, Ilya Salmanzadeh, and Beyoncé; “Never Too Late,” written by Elton John and Tim Rice; and “He Lives in You,” from the Broadway version of the film, written by Mark Mancina, Jay Rifkin, and Lebo M.

But one small misstep takes him from the streets of New York City to The Great Before—a fantastical place where new souls get their personalities, quirks, and interests before they go to Earth. Determined to return to his life, Joe teams up with a precocious soul, 22, who has never understood the appeal of the human experience. As Joe desperately tries to show 22 what’s great about living, he may just discover the answers to some of life’s most important questions. Directed by Pete Docter. Originally planned for theatrical release, it was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was instead released digitally December 25, 2020, on Disney+, following an October 11 premiere at the London Film Festival and other international releases. It later had a run at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, March 29–April 1, 2021. Voices include Jamie Foxx (Joe), Tina Fey (22), Phylicia Rashad (Libba Gardner), Graham Norton (Moonwind), Rachel House (Terry), Alice Braga (Counselor Jerry), Richard Ayoade (Counselor Jerry), Donnell Rawlings (Dez), Angela Bassett (Dorothea Williams), Wes Studi (Counselor), Fortune Feimster (Counselor), Zenobia Shroff (Counselor), June Squibb (Gerol), with talent from the music world, including Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson (Curley), Daveed Diggs (Paul). 100 min. Features original jazz compositions by Jon Batiste, with a score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross that drifts between the real and soul worlds. For authentic piano playing, multiple camera setups captured footage of Batiste’s fingers on the keys; new technology was used, which lit up piano keys on a rig, allowing animators to accurately place Joe’s fingers. Filmmakers took special care to ensure different skin types were authentically depicted, also rendering an array of black hair with a variety of textures and colors. To showcase the vast expanse of The Great Before, the film uses the cinematic 2.39:1 aspect ratio. Pixar technology also had to be modified to give the ethereal realm its soft look, such as giving grass a feather-like quality, versus the highly realistic grass-blades used in other Pixar films. Nominated for 3 Academy Awards, winning for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Score.",

But when an evil force (the Druun) threatened the land, the dragons sacrificed themselves to save humanity. Now, 500 years later, that same evil has returned, and it’s up to a lone warrior, Raya, to track down the legendary last dragon to restore the fractured land and its divided people. Along her journey, she’ll learn that it will take more than a dragon to save the world—it’s going to take trust and teamwork, as well. Directed by Don Hall and Carlos López Estrada.

The 5 lands of Kumandra form the shape of a dragon: Heart, a land of peace and magic; Fang, a thriving land surrounded by water; Spine, an insular land whose people distrust outsiders; Talon, a bustling crossroads; and Tail, a desert. The lands were animated with more than 72,000 individual elements, including 18,987 human and 35,749 nonhuman characters. For authenticity, combat sequences were inspired by martial arts specific to the cultures of Southeast Asia, such as Pencak Silat and Muay Thai. The end-credits song, “Lead the Way,” was written/performed by Jhené Aiko. Nearly all shot production took place in the homes of more than 450 artists and crew members during the COVID-19 pandemic.
